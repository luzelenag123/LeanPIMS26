Datatypes

Inductively Defined Types
===


All the types we've been looking at
```lean
ℕ, ℚ, ℝ, List,  ...
```
are *inductively defined*. That means, they are defined by

   - Some number of base cases
   - Some number of recursive constructors

We'll have more to say about the theory of inductive types later.
For now we'll describe them via examples.
-/

/-
Natural Numbers
===
We can redefine the natural numbers with the definition:

-/

inductive MyNat where
  | zero : MyNat               -- base case
  | succ : MyNat → MyNat         -- recursive constructor

/-
opening the namespace MyNat allows us to type `zero` instead of `MyNat.zero`.
-/

open MyNat

#check zero                  -- 0
#check succ zero             -- 1
#check succ (succ zero)      -- 2
#check zero.succ             -- alternative syntax for 1
#check zero.succ.succ        -- alternative syntax for 2

/-
This is how you build the natural numbers in Lean. The numerals 0, 1, 2, etc.
are just "syntactic sugar".
 -/

#eval Nat.zero == 0                      -- True
#eval Nat.zero.succ.succ.succ == 3       -- True

/-
Complex Numbers
===

Many types are inductive. For example, here is a complex number:
-/

inductive MyComplex where
  | mk : Real → Real → MyComplex

#check MyComplex.mk 1 2       -- 1 + 2i

/- Recall that you can match the way an inductive type was constructed. -/

def MyComplex.re (x : MyComplex) : Real :=
  match x with
  | mk a _ => a

def MyComplex.im (x : MyComplex) : Real :=
  match x with
  | mk _ b => b

noncomputable      -- Real.sqrt is non-computable
def MyComplex.abs (x : MyComplex) : Real := Real.sqrt (x.re^2 + x.im^2)

/-
Three Valued Logic
===

Not all inductive types have _recursive_ constructors. `Bool` has only base cases.
Here's a similar example:
-/

inductive TriBool where
  | T : TriBool
  | F : TriBool
  | U : TriBool

open TriBool

def and (A B : TriBool) :=
  match A, B with
  | T, x   => x
  | F, _   => F
  | U, F   => F
  | U, _   => U

#eval and T (and U F)   -- F


/-
Option
===

The `Option` type is useful in situations where a value might not be available.
This is an example of an inductive type that depends on another type.

-/

inductive MyOption (A : Type)
  | none : MyOption A
  | some : A → MyOption A

/- In the definition below, Lean knows the return type is `Option`. Thus,
we can use the `.` notation to call methods in the `Option` namespace
when in the expression. -/

def first {A : Type} (L : List A) : Option A :=
  match L with
  | [] => .none
  | x :: _ => .some x

/- Some examples: -/

#eval first [1,2,3]             -- some 1
#eval first ([]:List Int)       -- none

/-
Matching Option
===

You can use match to get the value of an `Option`, if it exists. -/

def my_func (L : List ℕ) : List ℕ :=
  let x := first L
  match x with
  | .some x => [x,x+1]
  | .none => [0,1]

/-
`Option` is an example of a `Monad`. A similar Monad is `Except`, which
also takes a string argument. We'll get to these later.
-/

#check Except


/-
Exercises
===

<ex/> Define an alternative complex number in terms of its magnitude and argument.
Note that the type of non-negative reals is defined as `NNReal` in Mathlib.

<ex/> Define `or` for `TriBool`.

<ex /> Lean's rational number type `ℚ` defines `1/0` to be `0`. Define a function
`reciprocal (x : ℚ) : Option ℚ` that returns `none` when `x` is zero.

-/



/-
Binary Trees
===

Here is a an extended example where we define a polymorphic Binary Tree type and
show how to start a library of functions for it. -/

inductive BTree (A : Type) where
  | leaf : A → BTree A
  | node : A → BTree A → BTree A → BTree A

/- Once a new type is defined, we usually put all of its functions in a *namespace*.
The following line opens that namespace. -/

namespace BTree

#check leaf            -- A → BTree A
#check node            -- A → BTree A → BTree A → BTree A

/-
Defining a Binary Tree
===

Here's an example tree.
-/

def my_tree := node 1 (leaf 2) (node 3 (leaf 4) (leaf 5))

/-
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQeSlUTnaC2yPFo8vJgGKOCTcHxq63r2fP37AMPvyMGzSi53ZkclclgY51zSN4D3sCczjretVs3HIQW/pub?w=960&amp;h=720" width=30%>

-/


/-
Defining Functions on Inductive Types
===

Here's an example function to convert tree to a list. -/

def to_list {A : Type} (T : BTree A) : List A :=
  match T with
  | leaf a => [a]
  | node a left right => [a] ++ (to_list left) ++ (to_list right)

#eval to_list my_tree   -- [1,2,3,4,5]

/-
Representing Values
===

When we define a tree and evaluate it, we get a cumbersome representation:  -/

#eval my_tree -- BTree.node 1 (BTree.leaf 2)
              -- (BTree.node 3 (BTree.leaf 4) (BTree.leaf 5))

/- We can tell Lean to make a more compact representation. First we define a `to_str`
function. It requires that `A` has a `toString` instance we can use (more on this later). -/

def to_str {A : Type} [ToString A] (T : BTree A) : String :=
  match T with
  | leaf a => toString a
  | node a L R =>  "(" ++ (toString a) ++ " " ++ (to_str L) ++ " " ++ (to_str R) ++ ")"

/- The we define a _representation_ of a tree (using the representation of `A`).-/

instance {A : Type} [Repr A] [ToString A] : Repr (BTree A) := {
  reprPrec := fun T _ => to_str T
}

/-
Now when we evaluate we get: -/

#eval my_tree             -- (1 2 (3 4 5))


/-
Mapping to Trees
===

Here is an example function. Note the use of curly braces since `A` and
`B` are inferable from the argument `f`.

-/

def map {A B : Type} (f : A → B) (T : BTree A) : BTree B :=
  match T with
  | leaf a => leaf (f a)
  | node a left right => node (f a) (map f left) (map f right)

#eval map (fun x => x*x) (node 0 my_tree my_tree)

/- By the way, since we opened the namespace `BTree`, the functions we defined
are in the `BTree` namespace, accessible after we close it using `.` -/

end BTree

#check BTree.to_list
#check BTree.map

/- Even better, values of type BTree can use the methods via the `.`. -/

def T : BTree ℕ := BTree.leaf 0

#eval T.map Nat.succ


/-
Exercises
===

<ex/> Define a function `swap` that takes a `BTree` and swaps the order of the
children in all nodes. You should get, for example:

```lean
#eval swap my_tree             -- (1 (3 5 4) 2)
```
-/


/-
Mutually Inductive Types
===

Sometimes you want to define two types inductively where the definition of
one depends on the definition of the other. For example:
-/

mutual
  inductive Ev
  | zero : Ev
  | succ : Od → Ev

  inductive Od
  | succ : Ev → Od
end

#check Ev.succ (Od.succ Ev.zero)

/-
Expression Trees
===
A common use case for mutual induction is to define terms and expressions.
-/

mutual
  inductive Term
  | var : String → Term
  | num : ℕ → Term
  | paren : Expr → Term

  inductive Expr
  | neg : Term → Expr
  | add : Term → Term → Expr
  | mul : Term → Term → Expr
end

/-
Here's how you would encode 2*(x+1)
-/

open Expr Term in
def expr : Expr := mul (num 2) (paren (add (var "x") (num 1)))

/-
Exercises
===

<ex /> Write a function `Expr.CountAdds` that takes an `Expr` and returns the number of
additions in it. You will need an auxiliary function and you will have to put both
definitions in a mutual block, since they call each other.

-/

mutual
  def Term.CountAdds (t : Term) : ℕ := sorry
  def Expr.CountAdds (e : Expr) : ℕ := sorry
end


/-
Structures
===

Recall the pattern for `MyComplex` in which we

- defined an inductive type with a constructor of the form `A → A → A`
- defined accessors with `match x with | mk x y = x`.

That is so common that Lean has a convenience notation:
If you have an inductive type with *one* constructor, then you can use a *structure*.

-/

structure Komplex where
  re : Real
  im : Real

open Komplex

def conj (x : Komplex) : Komplex:= {
  re := x.re,
  im := -x.im
}

/-
Type Hints are Often Required
===

Q: Why do you think this doesn't work

```lean
def conj (x : Komplex) := {
  re := x.re,
  im := -x.im
}
```
-/

/-
Bracket Notation
===

You can use the `⟨ a, b ⟩` if the type is known. For example

-/

def add (x y : Komplex) : Komplex :=
  ⟨ x.re + y.re, x.im + y.im ⟩

def negate (x : Komplex) : Komplex := ⟨ -x.re, -x.im ⟩

/-
Match with Structures
===

You can use structures as though they were inductive types (since they are). -/

def negate1 (x : Komplex) : Komplex :=
  match x with | mk a b => ⟨ -a, -b ⟩

def negate2 (x : Komplex) : Komplex :=
  match x with | ⟨ a, b ⟩ => ⟨ -a, -b ⟩

def negate3 (x : Komplex) : Komplex :=
  let ⟨ a, b ⟩ := x
  ⟨ -a, -b ⟩

def negate4 (x : Komplex) : Komplex := ⟨ -x.1, -x.2 ⟩



/-
Fields Can Depend on Other Fields
===

For example, here is a type that stores a type and a value of that type.
-/

structure Dyn where
  α : Type
  val : α

/- This particular type is useful for making heterogeneous lists. -/

def L : List Dyn := [ ⟨ ℕ, 3 ⟩, ⟨ String, "three"⟩ ]

/-
<div class='fn'>Note that <tt>Dyn</tt> is isomorphic to <tt>Σ α, α</tt>,
which is a <tt>Sigma</tt> type, which also has this property.
So we could have written <tt>List (Σ α, α)</tt>.</div>
-/


/-
Structures Can Be Self-Referential
===
Here is an example of a structure that references itself.
-/

structure Node where
  label : String
  next  : Option Node

/- An example value is : -/

def chain : Node :=
  {
    label := "a",
    next  := some { label := "b", next := none }
  }

/-
Note that not using `Option` type checks, but without additional assumptions
has no inhabitants.
-/

structure Node' where
  label : String
  next  : Node'





/-
Extending Structures
===

You may also see examples where a structure extends other structures.
-/

structure A where
  x : ℕ

structure B where
  y : ℕ

structure C extends A, B where
  z : ℕ

/- A value of type `C` has three fields: -/

def c : C := { x := 1, y := 2, z := 3 }

/-
Exercises
===

<ex/> Define a structure `Vector3D`.

<ex/> Define a cross product function of two `Vector3D` terms and test it on examples.

-/



/-
Products
===

Products represent a pair of objects.

-/

structure MyProd (A B : Type) where
  fst : A
  snd : B

def p : MyProd Rat String := ⟨ 0, "zero" ⟩

#eval p.fst
#eval p.snd

/- Lean's Prod uses `×`: -/

def q : Rat × String := ⟨ 1, "one" ⟩

/-
Using Products
===
We could have defined
-/

def Komplex' := ℝ × ℝ
def Komplex'.re (x : Komplex') := x.fst

/-
and so on. Or

-/

def Point {α : Type} := α × α
def Vector3D' := ℚ × ℚ × ℚ

/- The benefit is that you get a bunch of defined functions for products.
The downsides are
- the defined type may not really be a cross product space (e.g. complex numbers
have inverses, but pairs don't).
- you have to define a lot of synonyms (e.g. `x.re = x.fst`) anyway.

-/

/-
Π-Types
===

A Π-Type is a generalization of a product. In type theory it is a core object not defined
in terms of some other notion.

An example of a _non-dependent_ `Pi-Type` is the set of infinite sequences of rationals.
-/

def Qn := Π _n : ℕ, ℚ

/-
This is definitionally equal to -/

def Qn' := (ℕ → ℚ)

/- An example is -/

def harmonic_sequence : Qn := fun n => 1/(n+1)

/-
Dependent Π-Types
===

To build an example of a _dependent_ Π-type, we first need a _dependent type_,
which is a type that depends on a parameter. For example, `Fin n` is the set of
natural numbers less than `n` (defined in the `Prelude` as a structure).

From `Fin n` we can construct
-/

def DPT := Π n : ℕ, Fin (n+1)

/- or equivalently -/

def DPT' := (n : ℕ) → Fin (n+1)

/-
which is the set of sequences `σ` of natural numbers where `σ(n) < n`. For example,
-/

def σ1 : DPT := fun n => ⟨ n, by lia ⟩
def σ2 : DPT' := fun n => ⟨ n/2, by lia ⟩

/- Since we haven't covered proofs yet, we'll dig in to these ideas later. -/

/-
Sums
===

A sum type represents the _choice_ of value from one of two sets.
So a value is constructed as either "in left" or "in right".

-/

inductive MySum (A B : Type) where
  | inl : A → MySum A B
  | inr : B → MySum A B

def s1 : MySum Rat String := .inl 0
def s2 : MySum Rat String := .inr "zero"

def swap (s : MySum Rat String) : MySum String Rat :=
  match s with
  | .inl x => .inr x
  | .inr x => .inl x

/- Lean's Sum uses `⊕`: -/

def s : Rat ⊕ String := .inl 1

/-
An Alternative ℕ
===

An illustrative use of sums is to build on our definition of Even and Odd numbers with:

-/

def Naturals := Ev ⊕ Od

/- Zero and successor can be defined with: -/

def Naturals.zero : Naturals := .inl Ev.zero

def Naturals.succ (x : Naturals) : Naturals := match x with
  | .inl a => .inr (Od.succ a)
  | .inr a => .inl (Ev.succ a)

/-
Sums as Co-products
===

<img src='img/coprod.jpg' class='img-up-right' width=20%></img>

Suppose we have two disjoint copies of a space `X`. Then `X ⊕ X` <br>
is the type of points in that space. They are either a point <br>
from the "left" side or a point in the "right" side.

For example, to start building an identification topology we might:
-/

def TwoR := ℝ ⊕ ℝ

def equiv (x y : TwoR) : Prop := match x,y with
  | .inl a, .inl b => a = b
  | .inr a, .inr b => a = b
  | .inl a, .inr b => a = 0 ∧ b = 0
  | .inr a, .inl b => a = 0 ∧ b = 0

/- Then show `equiv` is an equivalence relation and take the quotient

```lean
TwoR / equiv
```
We'll get to what this means and how to do it later. -/



/-
Σ-Types
===

A Σ-Type represents a choice of an object from a single set. These are defined inductively.

```lean
structure Sigma {α : Type} (β : α → Type) where
  fst : α
  snd : α → β fst
```

Lean provides several equivalent notations:
-/

def SigT   := Sigma (fun n : ℕ => Fin n)
def SigT'  := Σ n : ℕ, (Fin n)
def SigT'' := (n:ℕ) × (Fin n)

/- As an example of a value: -/

def x : SigT := ⟨ 3, 2 ⟩     -- 2 has type Fin 3

/-
Exercises
===

<ex /> Rewrite your cross product function in terms of `ℚ × ℚ × ℚ`.

<ex /> You can specify a circle with a single point `r : ℚ` and a rectangle
with a pair of points `x y : ℚ`. Thus a shape might be defined as
-/

def Shape := ℚ ⊕ (ℚ × ℚ)

/- define functions `area (s : Shape) : ℚ` and `perimeter (s : Shape) : ℚ`.
Approximate π with `22/7` (or whatever your favorite approximate is).-/

#check Real.pi

/-
Notation
===

Lean uses user-defined syntax extensively to make code look more like math.

This can make it challenging to figure out what an expression means.

For example, suppose we defined addition as
-/

def MyNat.add (x y : MyNat) :=
  match x with
  | .zero => y
  | .succ k => .succ (MyNat.add k y)

/- The we can register a syntax directive like: -/

infix:65 " + " => MyNat.add

/- so we can write: -/

#eval MyNat.zero.succ + MyNat.zero.succ.succ


/-
Notation for Term and Expr
===

Recall our `Expr` class in which `2*x+1` was represented as
```lean
mul (num 2) (paren (add (var "x") (num 1)))
```

At the risk of completely befuddling our user, we can overload some notation.
Here we use _notation classes_ instead of _syntax_ directives.
-/

open Term Expr

instance : Coe String Term where coe s := Term.var s
instance : HMul Term Term Expr := ⟨ mul ⟩
instance : HMul ℕ Expr Expr := ⟨ fun x y => mul (num x) (paren y) ⟩
instance : HAdd Term Term Expr := ⟨ add ⟩
instance : HAdd Term ℕ Expr := ⟨ fun x y => add x (num y) ⟩
instance : Coe Expr Term := ⟨ paren ⟩

/-
Now we can write, for example:
-/

def t1 : Expr := 2 * (var "x" + 1)



/-
Notation in Lean is Endless
===
-/


/- The ways in which you can define your own syntax in Lean are many and varied.

Pros:
  - You can make expressions easier to read
  - You can make code look more like math

Cons:
  - You can confuse users
  - You have to refactor all your notation when you change your library

In any case, we will introduce these mechanisms as we need them.

See the [Lean Language Reference](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/Notations-and-Macros/#language-extension).


Summary
===

- Inductive types are fundamental to Lean (and Type Theory)
- Structures are inductive types with one constructor and many methods
- Products and sums record pairs and choices, respectively
- Π-types are generalizations of products, and are built in
- Σ-types are generalized choices, and are defined as structures
- Notation can be defined for _anything_ you want. Use with care.

These data types can be used to construct a large part of mathematics,
including algebra, topology, analysis, logic, computability, and so on.


Exercises
===

<ex/> Define a polymorphic tree type `MyTree` where every node may have any number of
children (using List). Define a few example trees demonstrating the features of your datatype.

Exercises
===

<ex/> Consider the Dyadic Rationals, which consist of fractions who's
denominators are powers of two. We can define PreDyadics as follows.
We use the name `PreDyadic` elements in this type are not unique.
Later we will use this definition to define the Dyadic Rationals properly.

-/

namespace Temp

inductive PreDyadic where
  | zero    : PreDyadic
  | add_one : PreDyadic → PreDyadic  -- x ↦ x + 1
  | half    : PreDyadic → PreDyadic  -- x ↦ x / 2
