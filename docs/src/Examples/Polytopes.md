Polytopes --Luz Elena Grisales Gómez

Overview
===

One can represent polytopes in two ways:

- As the convex hull of finitely many points. In this case, we refer to it as a `V-polytope`.

- As the bounded intersection of finitely many closed halfspaces. In this case, we refer to it as an `H-polytope`.

These two representations are equivalent due to the `Minkowski-Weyl Theorem`.



Set up
===
We'll need to perform pointwise operations and use noncomputable constructions (e.g. axiom of choice). For this, we will use:

```lean
-- using `scoped` below imports only the notation.
open scoped Pointwise
noncomputable section
```

We'll also need to define the space in which our polytopes will live:

```lean
variable {E : Type*}
  [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E] [DecidableEq E]
```

V-Polytopes
===
We can define V-Polytopes as a structure storing its set of generating points.

```lean
structure VPolytope (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
where
  points : Finset E
```

 Next, we'll add a few definitions directly associated to a VPolytope. For this, we create a namespace.

```lean
namespace VPolytope
```

The namespace
===
The `carrier` is going to produce the underlying set associated to the `VPolytope` structure. 
```lean
def carrier (P : VPolytope E) : Set E :=
  convexHull ℝ (↑P.points : Set E)
```
The `translate` map is going to produce a new `VPolytope` resulting from translating `P` by the vector `v`. 
```lean
def translate (P : VPolytope E) (v : E) : VPolytope E :=
  ⟨v +ᵥ P.points⟩
```

The definitions and theorems written inside this namespace can be accessed from outside the namespace by writting `VPolytope.{definition\theorem}`.


isCompact, isConvex
===
We can write simple theorems like the following inside this namespace.

```lean
theorem isCompact (P : VPolytope E) : IsCompact P.carrier := by
  simpa [carrier] using
    (P.points.finite_toSet).isCompact_convexHull
      (𝕜 := ℝ)
      (s := (↑P.points : Set E))

theorem isConvex (P : VPolytope E) : Convex ℝ P.carrier := by
  simpa [VPolytope.carrier] using
          (convex_convexHull ℝ (↑P.points : Set E))

end VPolytope
```

Exercise
===
Search Mathlib's `Compact.lean` file for theorems that help prove `isClosed` and `isBounded` in just one line.

```lean
theorem isBounded (P : VPolytope E) : Bornology.IsBounded P.carrier := by
  sorry

theorem isClosed (P : VPolytope E) : IsClosed P.carrier := by
  sorry
```


Halfspaces
===
We can naturally define a halfspace as follows:

```lean
structure Halfspace (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
where
  normal : E
  offset : ℝ
```

This a aligns with the mathematical definition of a halfspace depending only on a normal vector and an offset.


The namespace
===
Inside the Halfspace namespace we can define the carrier to be:

```lean
namespace Halfspace

def carrier (h : Halfspace E) : Set (E) :=
  {x | inner ℝ h.normal x ≤ h.offset}
```
 We can also prove that a Halfspace is `isClosed` as follows:
```lean
theorem isClosed (H : Halfspace E) : IsClosed H.carrier := by
  dsimp [carrier]
  apply isClosed_le
  · exact Continuous.inner continuous_const continuous_id
  · exact continuous_const
```

Inferring DecidableEq
===
`DecidableEq` is a typeclass in Lean. To tell Lean that the `Halfspace` type has decidable equality, we need to instantiate this typeclass.

Lean can sometimes infer the instance using the tactic `infer_instance`:

```lean
instance [DecidableEq E] : DecidableEq (Halfspace E) := by
  classical
  infer_instance
```
 We need `DecidableEq` in order to be able to create sets of halfspaces.
```lean
end Halfspace
```

Exercise
===
Use the help of AI to generate a proof for `isConvex`.
```lean
theorem isConvex (H : Halfspace E) : Convex ℝ H.carrier := by
  sorry
```


H-Polyhedra
===

An **H-Polyhedron** is a finite intersection of halfspaces. An **H-Polytope** is an H-Polyhedron that is also bounded. In Lean, we can encode this as follows:

```lean
structure HPolyhedron (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
where
  (halfspaces : Finset (Halfspace E))

namespace HPolyhedron

def carrier (P : HPolyhedron E) : Set E :=
  ⋂ h ∈ P.halfspaces, (h.carrier)

end HPolyhedron
```

H-Polytopes
===
Since an H-Polytope is an H-Polyhedron with additional conditions, we can use `extends` in Lean.

```lean
structure HPolytope (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
extends HPolyhedron E where
  (bounded : Bornology.IsBounded (toHPolyhedron.carrier))
```

We are extending the `HPolyhedron` definition y adding the condiiton that it must be `bounded`.

If defined like this, an `HPolytope` will inherit definitions and theorems defined for an `HPolyhedron`.


Exercise
===
**Extra Challenge:** Define how to translate an `HPolyhedron` inside its namespace.

```lean
def translate (P : HPolyhedron E) (v : E) : HPolyhedron E :=
  sorry
```


Duality
===
A key tool in prove the Minkowski-Weyl Theorem is duality.

Some version of duality is already implemented in Mathlib, but it is too general and difficult to parse for our purposes, so we implement our own:

```lean
def dual (P : Set E) : Set E :=
  ⋂ x ∈ (P \ {0}), (Halfspace.mk x 1).carrier
```

The dual of a VPolytope
===
One can observe directly from the definition of duality the the dual of a VPolytope is an HPolyhedron (because points become halfspaces).

Therefore, we can define the dual of a `VPolytope` as:

```lean
def VPolytope.dual (P : VPolytope E) : HPolyhedron E :=
  { halfspaces := P.points.image (fun x => Halfspace.mk x 1) }
```

A natural theorem would then be:

```lean
theorem dual_of_VPolytope (P : VPolytope E) : dual P.carrier = P.dual.carrier := sorry
```

This is a long Lean proof, so we are not doing it today. If you want, you can try to generate a proof using AI.


Exercise
===
Prove the following basic properties of duality.

```lean
namespace dual

theorem zero_mem (P : Set E) : (0 : E) ∈ dual P := by
  sorry

theorem isAntitone {A B : Set E} (h : A ⊆ B) : dual B ⊆ dual A := by
  sorry

end dual
```

It is also true that the dual of a set of is closed and convex, and should follow directly from the Halfspace properties.


Main Theorems
===
Some of the main theorems we want to prove in order to establish the equivalence between VPolytopes and HPolytope include:

```lean
theorem separation_compact_closed
    {C D : Set E}
    (hC_nonempty : C.Nonempty)
    (hC_convex : Convex ℝ C) (hC_compact : IsCompact C)
    (hD_nonempty : D.Nonempty)
    (hD_convex : Convex ℝ D) (hD_closed : IsClosed D)
    (hdisj : Disjoint C D) :
    ∃ (a : E) (b : ℝ),
      a ≠ 0 ∧
      C ⊆ {x | inner ℝ a x < b} ∧
      D ⊆ {x | inner ℝ a x > b} := sorry
```

Main Theorems (continued)
===

```lean
theorem dual_of_dual
  (X : Set E) :
  dual (dual X)
    = closure (convexHull ℝ (Set.union X ({0} : Set E))) := sorry

theorem HPolytope_is_VPolytope : ∀ P : HPolytope E, ∃ Q : VPolytope E, P.carrier = Q.carrier := sorry
