Russell's Paradox
===

Let `S` be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.

If `S ∈ S` then by definition `S ∉ S`.

If `S ∉ S` then by definition `S ∈ S`.

Set Theory, this is avoided by only allowing set definitions
to refer only to existing sets.



Girard's Paradox
===

Similarly, if you allow type definitions to quantify over all types (including
themselves), you end up with a paradox.

Allowing quantification over the thing being defined is called *Impredicativity*.

Most type theories disallow impredicativity for general types, but does allow it for a
special type `Prop`, as we shall see.



Universe Hierarchy
===

Lean, and most Type Theories, define a hierarchy of universes

    - Sort 0 = Prop
    - Sort 1 = Type 0 = Type
    - Sort 2 = Type 1
    ...

All types have types:

    - Prop : Sort 1          (read: Prop "has type" Sort 1)
    - Type u : Type u+1

Now expressions don't quantify over all types,
they quantify over types in lower universe levels.

Types in Lean
===

You can use `#check` to check types

```lean
#check Prop            -- Type

#check Type            -- Type 1
#check Type 0          -- Type 1

#check Type 12         -- Type 13

#check_failure Type 100 -- Universe level offset `100`
                        -- exceeds maximum offset `32`
```
 Most math does not require many universe levels,
but various categorical constructions do.  

Universe Variables
===

You can declare universes with the universe keyword:

```lean
universe u v
def f1 (x : Type u) : Type u := x
```
 Or you can use the dot notation 
```lean
def f2.{w} (x : Type w) : Type w := x
```

A function with a universe variable is then *universe polymorphic*

```lean
#check f2                         -- Type v → Type v
#check f2 Nat                     -- Type (since Nat : Type)
#check f2 (List (Type 0))         -- Type 1, since Lists of type can't have their
                                  -- own types as elements
```

Self Application Does not Work
===

You can't apply `f2` to itself: 
```lean
#check_failure f2 f2
```
 Gives

```lean
Application type mismatch: The argument
  f2
has type
  Type ?u.27 → Type ?u.27
but is expected to have type
  Type ?u.27
in the application
  f2 f2
```


Function Types
===
Functions have type `Type u → Type v` for some universe levels `u` and `v`.

```lean
def my_id (x : Type u) := x

#check my_id             -- Type → Type
#check my_id String      -- Type → Type
```

Since `Type → Type` is a type, it must have a type. 
```lean
#check Type → Type       -- Type 1
```

If the type of `Type → Type` were `Type`, then `Type` would contain a function
whose domain and codomain are both `Type`, meaning it would contain an element
that refers to itself.


Type Arithmetic
===

You can
- Add natural numbers to universes
- Take the max of two universes


```lean
#check Type (u+1)
#check Type (max u v)
```
 For example 
```lean
#check Prod             -- Type u → Type v → Type (max u v)
#check Type u × Type v  --  Type (max (u + 1) (v + 1))
```

Prop is Impredicative
===

Generally you cannot have a type built from other types live in the same unvierse level.

For example, if you change `u+1` to `u` below, you get a type error.


```lean
def MyProd (α β : Type u) : Type (u+1) :=
  Π X : Type u, (α → β → X) → X
```

However, with `Prop` you *ca*n make such definitions.

```lean
def MyPropProd (α β : Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ X : Prop, (α → β → X) → X
```
 This is because `Prop` is impredicative in Lean, unlike all other types. 

How `Prop` Avoids Paradoxes
===

Even though `Prop` is impredicative, the language is carefully designed to avoid
allowing paradoxes.

This is achieved via ***proof irrelevance***: All proofs `h : p` where `p : Prop` are equivalent.

The result is that propositions cannot depend on the particular way a proof is written,
and so lack the expressive power to encode Girard's paradox.



More Type Arithmetic
===

Because `Prop` is impredicative, sometimes you need a version of `max`
except when the codomain of a function is `Prop`. Then you can use `imax`
```lean
imax u v := if v = 0 then 0 else max u v
#check Type (imax 1 0)   -- 0
#check Type (imax 0 1)   -- 1
```

 For example, 
```lean
variable (α : Sort u) (β : α → Sort v)
#check (Π x : α, β x)                   -- Sort (imax u v)
```

If `α := Type 2` and `β x := Type 3`:
```
#check (Π x : α, β x)           -- Type 3
```
If `α := Type 2` and `β x := Prop` then
```
#check (Π x : α, β x)           -- Prop, equiv to ∀ x, β x
```
