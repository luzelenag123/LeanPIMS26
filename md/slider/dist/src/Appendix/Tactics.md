  Goals left:
    case h1 ⊢ a = b
    case h2 ⊢ d = b
    case h3 ⊢ c + a.pred = c + d.pred
    
```lean
sorry
    sorry
    sorry

  example {a b : ℕ} (h : a = b) : (fun y : ℕ => ∀ z, a + a = z) = (fun x => ∀ z, b + a = z) := by
    congrm fun x => ∀ w, ?_ + a = w
    -- ⊢ a = b
    exact h
  ```

  The `congrm` command is a convenient frontend to `congr(...)` congruence quotations.
  If the goal is an equality, `congrm e` is equivalent to `refine congr(e')` where `e'` is
  built from `e` by replacing each placeholder `?m` by `$(?m)`.
  The pattern `e` is allowed to contain `$(...)` expressions to immediately substitute
  equality proofs into the congruence, just like for congruence quotations.

syntax "congrm?"... [tacticCongrm?]
  Display a widget panel allowing to generate a `congrm` call with holes specified by selecting
  subexpressions in the goal.

syntax "constructor"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.constructor]
  If the main goal's target type is an inductive type, `constructor` solves it with
  the first matching constructor, or else fails.

syntax "constructorm"... [Mathlib.Tactic.constructorM]
  * `constructorm p_1, ..., p_n` applies the `constructor` tactic to the main goal
    if `type` matches one of the given patterns.
  * `constructorm* p` is a more efficient and compact version of `· repeat constructorm p`.
    It is more efficient because the pattern is compiled once.

  Example: The following tactic proves any theorem like `True ∧ (True ∨ True)` consisting of
  and/or/true:
  ```
  constructorm* _ ∨ _, _ ∧ _, True
  ```

syntax "continuity"... [tacticContinuity]
  The tactic `continuity` solves goals of the form `Continuous f` by applying lemmas tagged with the
  `continuity` user attribute.

  `fun_prop` is a (usually more powerful) alternative to `continuity`.

syntax "continuity?"... [tacticContinuity?]
  The tactic `continuity` solves goals of the form `Continuous f` by applying lemmas tagged with the
  `continuity` user attribute.

syntax "contradiction"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.contradiction]
  `contradiction` closes the main goal if its hypotheses are "trivially contradictory".

  - Inductive type/family with no applicable constructors
    ```lean
    example (h : False) : p := by contradiction
    ```
  - Injectivity of constructors
    ```lean
    example (h : none = some true) : p := by contradiction  --
    ```
  - Decidable false proposition
    ```lean
    example (h : 2 + 2 = 3) : p := by contradiction
    ```
  - Contradictory hypotheses
    ```lean
    example (h : p) (h' : ¬ p) : q := by contradiction
    ```
  - Other simple contradictions such as
    ```lean
    example (x : Nat) (h : x ≠ x) : p := by contradiction
    ```

syntax "contrapose"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Contrapose.contrapose]
  Transforms the goal into its contrapositive.
  * `contrapose` turns a goal `P → Q` into `¬ Q → ¬ P` and it turns a goal `P ↔ Q` into `¬ P ↔ ¬ Q`
  * `contrapose h` first reverts the local assumption `h`, and then uses `contrapose` and `intro h`
  * `contrapose h with new_h` uses the name `new_h` for the introduced hypothesis

syntax "contrapose!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Contrapose.contrapose!]
  Transforms the goal into its contrapositive and pushes negations in the result.
  Usage matches `contrapose`

syntax "conv"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.Conv.conv]
  `conv => ...` allows the user to perform targeted rewriting on a goal or hypothesis,
  by focusing on particular subexpressions.

  See <https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/conv.html> for more details.

  Basic forms:
  * `conv => cs` will rewrite the goal with conv tactics `cs`.
  * `conv at h => cs` will rewrite hypothesis `h`.
  * `conv in pat => cs` will rewrite the first subexpression matching `pat` (see `pattern`).

syntax "conv'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.Conv.convTactic]
  Executes the given conv block without converting regular goal into a `conv` goal.

syntax "conv?"... [tacticConv?]
  Display a widget panel allowing to generate a `conv` call zooming to the subexpression selected
  in the goal.

syntax "conv_lhs"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Conv.convLHS]

syntax "conv_rhs"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Conv.convRHS]

syntax "convert"... [Mathlib.Tactic.convert]
  The `exact e` and `refine e` tactics require a term `e` whose type is
  definitionally equal to the goal. `convert e` is similar to `refine e`,
  but the type of `e` is not required to exactly match the
  goal. Instead, new goals are created for differences between the type
  of `e` and the goal using the same strategies as the `congr!` tactic.
  For example, in the proof state

  ```lean
  n : ℕ,
  e : Prime (2 * n + 1)
  ⊢ Prime (n + n + 1)
  ```

  the tactic `convert e using 2` will change the goal to

  ```lean
  ⊢ n + n = 2 * n
  ```

  In this example, the new goal can be solved using `ring`.

  The `using 2` indicates it should iterate the congruence algorithm up to two times,
  where `convert e` would use an unrestricted number of iterations and lead to two
  impossible goals: `⊢ HAdd.hAdd = HMul.hMul` and `⊢ n = 2`.

  A variant configuration is `convert (config := .unfoldSameFun) e`, which only equates function
  applications for the same function (while doing so at the higher `default` transparency).
  This gives the same goal of `⊢ n + n = 2 * n` without needing `using 2`.

  The `convert` tactic applies congruence lemmas eagerly before reducing,
  therefore it can fail in cases where `exact` succeeds:
  ```lean
  def p (n : ℕ) := True
  example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by exact h -- succeeds
  example (h : p 0) : p 1 := by convert h -- fails, with leftover goal `1 = 0`
  ```
  Limiting the depth of recursion can help with this. For example, `convert h using 1` will work
  in this case.

  The syntax `convert ← e` will reverse the direction of the new goals
  (producing `⊢ 2 * n = n + n` in this example).

  Internally, `convert e` works by creating a new goal asserting that
  the goal equals the type of `e`, then simplifying it using
  `congr!`. The syntax `convert e using n` can be used to control the
  depth of matching (like `congr! n`). In the example, `convert e using 1`
  would produce a new goal `⊢ n + n + 1 = 2 * n + 1`.

  Refer to the `congr!` tactic to understand the congruence operations. One of its many
  features is that if `x y : t` and an instance `Subsingleton t` is in scope,
  then any goals of the form `x = y` are solved automatically.

  Like `congr!`, `convert` takes an optional `with` clause of `rintro` patterns,
  for example `convert e using n with x y z`.

  The `convert` tactic also takes a configuration option, for example
  ```lean
  convert (config := {transparency := .default}) h
  ```
  These are passed to `congr!`. See `Congr!.Config` for options.

syntax "convert_to"... [Mathlib.Tactic.convertTo]
  The `convert_to` tactic is for changing the type of the target or a local hypothesis,
  but unlike the `change` tactic it will generate equality proof obligations using `congr!`
  to resolve discrepancies.

  * `convert_to ty` changes the target to `ty`
  * `convert_to ty using n` uses `congr! n` instead of `congr! 1`
  * `convert_to ty at h` changes the type of the local hypothesis `h` to `ty`.
    Any remaining `congr!` goals come first.

  Operating on the target, the tactic `convert_to ty using n`
  is the same as `convert (?_ : ty) using n`.
  The difference is that `convert_to` takes a type but `convert` takes a proof term.

  Except for it also being able to operate on local hypotheses,
  the syntax for `convert_to` is the same as for `convert`, and it has variations such as
  `convert_to ← g` and `convert_to (config := {transparency := .default}) g`.

  Note that `convert_to ty at h` may leave a copy of `h` if a later local hypotheses or the target
  depends on it, just like in `rw` or `simp`.

syntax "cutsat"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.cutsat]
  `cutsat` solves linear integer arithmetic goals.

  It is a implemented as a thin wrapper around the `grind` tactic, enabling only the `cutsat` solver.
  Please use `grind` instead if you need additional capabilities.

syntax "dbg_trace"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.dbgTrace]
  `dbg_trace "foo"` prints `foo` when elaborated.
  Useful for debugging tactic control flow:
  ```
  example : False ∨ True := by
    first
    | apply Or.inl; trivial; dbg_trace "left"
    | apply Or.inr; trivial; dbg_trace "right"
  ```

syntax "decide"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.decide]
  `decide` attempts to prove the main goal (with target type `p`) by synthesizing an instance of `Decidable p`
  and then reducing that instance to evaluate the truth value of `p`.
  If it reduces to `isTrue h`, then `h` is a proof of `p` that closes the goal.

  The target is not allowed to contain local variables or metavariables.
  If there are local variables, you can first try using the `revert` tactic with these local variables to move them into the target,
  or you can use the `+revert` option, described below.

  Options:
  - `decide +revert` begins by reverting local variables that the target depends on,
    after cleaning up the local context of irrelevant variables.
    A variable is *relevant* if it appears in the target, if it appears in a relevant variable,
    or if it is a proposition that refers to a relevant variable.
  - `decide +kernel` uses kernel for reduction instead of the elaborator.
    It has two key properties: (1) since it uses the kernel, it ignores transparency and can unfold everything,
    and (2) it reduces the `Decidable` instance only once instead of twice.
  - `decide +native` uses the native code compiler (`#eval`) to evaluate the `Decidable` instance,
    admitting the result via the `Lean.ofReduceBool` axiom.
    This can be significantly more efficient than using reduction, but it is at the cost of increasing the size
    of the trusted code base.
    Namely, it depends on the correctness of the Lean compiler and all definitions with an `@[implemented_by]` attribute.
    Like with `+kernel`, the `Decidable` instance is evaluated only once.

  Limitation: In the default mode or `+kernel` mode, since `decide` uses reduction to evaluate the term,
  `Decidable` instances defined by well-founded recursion might not work because evaluating them requires reducing proofs.
  Reduction can also get stuck on `Decidable` instances with `Eq.rec` terms.
  These can appear in instances defined using tactics (such as `rw` and `simp`).
  To avoid this, create such instances using definitions such as `decidable_of_iff` instead.

  ## Examples

  Proving inequalities:
  ```lean
  example : 2 + 2 ≠ 5 := by decide
  ```

  Trying to prove a false proposition:
  ```lean
  example : 1 ≠ 1 := by decide
```

  tactic 'decide' proved that the proposition
    1 ≠ 1
  is false
  
```lean
```

  Trying to prove a proposition whose `Decidable` instance fails to reduce
  ```lean
  opaque unknownProp : Prop

  open scoped Classical in
  example : unknownProp := by decide
```

  tactic 'decide' failed for proposition
    unknownProp
  since its 'Decidable' instance reduced to
    Classical.choice ⋯
  rather than to the 'isTrue' constructor.
  
```lean
```

  ## Properties and relations

  For equality goals for types with decidable equality, usually `rfl` can be used in place of `decide`.
  ```lean
  example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by decide
  example : 1 + 1 = 2 := by rfl
  ```

syntax "decreasing_tactic"... [tacticDecreasing_tactic]
  `decreasing_tactic` is called by default on well-founded recursions in order
  to synthesize a proof that recursive calls decrease along the selected
  well founded relation. It can be locally overridden by using `decreasing_by tac`
  on the recursive definition, and it can also be globally extended by adding
  more definitions for `decreasing_tactic` (or `decreasing_trivial`,
  which this tactic calls).

syntax "decreasing_trivial"... [tacticDecreasing_trivial]
  Extensible helper tactic for `decreasing_tactic`. This handles the "base case"
  reasoning after applying lexicographic order lemmas.
  It can be extended by adding more macro definitions, e.g.
  ```
  macro_rules | `(tactic| decreasing_trivial) => `(tactic| linarith)
  ```

syntax "decreasing_trivial_pre_omega"... [tacticDecreasing_trivial_pre_omega]
  Variant of `decreasing_trivial` that does not use `omega`, intended to be used in core modules
  before `omega` is available.

syntax "decreasing_with"... [tacticDecreasing_with_]
  Constructs a proof of decreasing along a well founded relation, by simplifying, then applying
  lexicographic order lemmas and finally using `ts` to solve the base case. If it fails,
  it prints a message to help the user diagnose an ill-founded recursive definition.

syntax "delta"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.delta]
  `delta id1 id2 ...` delta-expands the definitions `id1`, `id2`, ....
  This is a low-level tactic, it will expose how recursive definitions have been
  compiled by Lean.

syntax "deriving_LawfulEq_tactic"... [tacticDeriving_LawfulEq_tactic]

syntax "deriving_LawfulEq_tactic_step"... [tacticDeriving_LawfulEq_tactic_step]

syntax "deriving_ReflEq_tactic"... [DerivingHelpers.tacticDeriving_ReflEq_tactic]

syntax "discrete_cases"... [CategoryTheory.Discrete.tacticDiscrete_cases]
  A simple tactic to run `cases` on any `Discrete α` hypotheses.

syntax "done"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.done]
  `done` succeeds iff there are no remaining goals.

syntax "dsimp"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.dsimp]
  The `dsimp` tactic is the definitional simplifier. It is similar to `simp` but only
  applies theorems that hold by reflexivity. Thus, the result is guaranteed to be
  definitionally equal to the input.

syntax "dsimp!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.dsimpAutoUnfold]
  `dsimp!` is shorthand for `dsimp` with `autoUnfold := true`.
  This will unfold applications of functions defined by pattern matching, when one of the patterns applies.
  This can be used to partially evaluate many definitions.

syntax "dsimp?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.dsimpTrace]
  `simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
  set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
  ```
  example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
    simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
  ```

  This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

syntax "dsimp?!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticDsimp?!_]
  `simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
  set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
  ```
  example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
    simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
  ```

  This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

syntax "eapply"... [Batteries.Tactic.tacticEapply_]
  `eapply e` is like `apply e` but it does not add subgoals for variables that appear
  in the types of other goals. Note that this can lead to a failure where there are
  no goals remaining but there are still metavariables in the term:
  ```
  example (h : ∀ x : Nat, x = x → True) : True := by
    eapply h
    rfl
    -- no goals
  -- (kernel) declaration has metavariables '_example'
  ```

syntax "econstructor"... [tacticEconstructor]
  `econstructor` is like `constructor`
  (it calls `apply` using the first matching constructor of an inductive datatype)
  except only non-dependent premises are added as new goals.

syntax "else"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacDepIfThenElse]
  In tactic mode, `if h : t then tac1 else tac2` can be used as alternative syntax for:
  ```
  by_cases h : t
  · tac1
  · tac2
  ```
  It performs case distinction on `h : t` or `h : ¬t` and `tac1` and `tac2` are the subproofs.

  You can use `?_` or `_` for either subproof to delay the goal to after the tactic, but
  if a tactic sequence is provided for `tac1` or `tac2` then it will require the goal to be closed
  by the end of the block.

syntax "else"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacIfThenElse]
  In tactic mode, `if t then tac1 else tac2` is alternative syntax for:
  ```
  by_cases t
  · tac1
  · tac2
  ```
  It performs case distinction on `h† : t` or `h† : ¬t`, where `h†` is an anonymous
  hypothesis, and `tac1` and `tac2` are the subproofs. (It doesn't actually use
  nondependent `if`, since this wouldn't add anything to the context and hence would be
  useless for proving theorems. To actually insert an `ite` application use
  `refine if t then ?_ else ?_`.)

syntax "enat_to_nat"... [Mathlib.Tactic.ENatToNat.tacticEnat_to_nat]
  `enat_to_nat` shifts all `ENat`s in the context to `Nat`, rewriting propositions about them.
  A typical use case is `enat_to_nat; omega`.

syntax "eq_refl"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.eqRefl]
  `eq_refl` is equivalent to `exact rfl`, but has a few optimizations.

syntax "erw"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticErw___]
  `erw [rules]` is a shorthand for `rw (transparency := .default) [rules]`.
  This does rewriting up to unfolding of regular definitions (by comparison to regular `rw`
  which only unfolds `@[reducible]` definitions).

syntax "erw?"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Erw?.erw?]
  `erw? [r, ...]` calls `erw [r, ...]` (at hypothesis `h` if written `erw [r, ...] at h`),
  and then attempts to identify any subexpression which would block the use of `rw` instead.
  It does so by identifying subexpressions which are defeq, but not at reducible transparency.

syntax "eta_expand"... [Mathlib.Tactic.etaExpandStx]
  `eta_expand at loc` eta expands all sub-expressions at the given location.
  It also beta reduces any applications of eta expanded terms, so it puts it
  into an eta-expanded "normal form."
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

  For example, if `f` takes two arguments, then `f` becomes `fun x y => f x y`
  and `f x` becomes `fun y => f x y`.

  This can be useful to turn, for example, a raw `HAdd.hAdd` into `fun x y => x + y`.

syntax "eta_reduce"... [Mathlib.Tactic.etaReduceStx]
  `eta_reduce at loc` eta reduces all sub-expressions at the given location.
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

  For example, `fun x y => f x y` becomes `f` after eta reduction.

syntax "eta_struct"... [Mathlib.Tactic.etaStructStx]
  `eta_struct at loc` transforms structure constructor applications such as `S.mk x.1 ... x.n`
  (pretty printed as, for example, `{a := x.a, b := x.b, ...}`) into `x`.
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

  The transformation is known as eta reduction for structures, and it yields definitionally
  equal expressions.

  For example, given `x : α × β`, then `(x.1, x.2)` becomes `x` after this transformation.

syntax "exact"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.exact]
  `exact e` closes the main goal if its target type matches that of `e`.

syntax "exact?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.exact?]
  Searches environment for definitions or theorems that can solve the goal using `exact`
  with conditions resolved by `solve_by_elim`.

  The optional `using` clause provides identifiers in the local context that must be
  used by `exact?` when closing the goal.  This is most useful if there are multiple
  ways to resolve the goal, and one wants to guide which lemma is used.

syntax "exact_mod_cast"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticExact_mod_cast_]
  Normalize casts in the goal and the given expression, then close the goal with `exact`.

syntax "exacts"... [Batteries.Tactic.exacts]
  Like `exact`, but takes a list of terms and checks that all goals are discharged after the tactic.

syntax "exfalso"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticExfalso]
  `exfalso` converts a goal `⊢ tgt` into `⊢ False` by applying `False.elim`.

syntax "exists"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.«tacticExists_,,»]
  `exists e₁, e₂, ...` is shorthand for `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ...⟩; try trivial`.
  It is useful for existential goals.

syntax "existsi"... [Mathlib.Tactic.«tacticExistsi_,,»]
  `existsi e₁, e₂, ⋯` applies the tactic `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_⟩`. It's purpose is to instantiate
  existential quantifiers.

  Examples:

  ```lean
  example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by
    existsi 42
    rfl

  example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by
    existsi 42, 42
    rfl
  ```

syntax "expose_names"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.exposeNames]
  `expose_names` renames all inaccessible variables with accessible names, making them available
  for reference in generated tactics. However, this renaming introduces machine-generated names
  that are not fully under user control. `expose_names` is primarily intended as a preamble for
  auto-generated end-game tactic scripts. It is also useful as an alternative to
  `set_option tactic.hygienic false`. If explicit control over renaming is needed in the
  middle of a tactic script, consider using structured tactic scripts with
  `match .. with`, `induction .. with`, or `intro` with explicit user-defined names,
  as well as tactics such as `next`, `case`, and `rename_i`.

syntax "ext"... [Lean.Elab.Tactic.Ext.ext]
  Applies extensionality lemmas that are registered with the `@[ext]` attribute.
  * `ext pat*` applies extensionality theorems as much as possible,
    using the patterns `pat*` to introduce the variables in extensionality theorems using `rintro`.
    For example, the patterns are used to name the variables introduced by lemmas such as `funext`.
  * Without patterns,`ext` applies extensionality lemmas as much
    as possible but introduces anonymous hypotheses whenever needed.
  * `ext pat* : n` applies ext theorems only up to depth `n`.

  The `ext1 pat*` tactic is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a single extensionality theorem.

  Unused patterns will generate warning.
  Patterns that don't match the variables will typically result in the introduction of anonymous hypotheses.

syntax "ext1"... [Lean.Elab.Tactic.Ext.tacticExt1___]
  `ext1 pat*` is like `ext pat*` except that it only applies a single extensionality theorem rather
  than recursively applying as many extensionality theorems as possible.

  The `pat*` patterns are processed using the `rintro` tactic.
  If no patterns are supplied, then variables are introduced anonymously using the `intros` tactic.

syntax "extract_goal"... [Mathlib.Tactic.ExtractGoal.extractGoal]
  - `extract_goal` formats the current goal as a stand-alone theorem or definition after
    cleaning up the local context of irrelevant variables.
    A variable is *relevant* if (1) it occurs in the target type, (2) there is a relevant variable
    that depends on it, or (3) the type of the variable is a proposition that depends on a
    relevant variable.

    If the target is `False`, then for convenience `extract_goal` includes all variables.
  - `extract_goal *` formats the current goal without cleaning up the local context.
  - `extract_goal a b c ...` formats the current goal after removing everything that the given
    variables `a`, `b`, `c`, ... do not depend on.
  - `extract_goal ... using name` uses the name `name` for the theorem or definition rather than
    the autogenerated name.

  The tactic tries to produce an output that can be copy-pasted and just work,
  but its success depends on whether the expressions are amenable
  to being unambiguously pretty printed.

  The tactic responds to pretty printing options.
  For example, `set_option pp.all true in extract_goal` gives the `pp.all` form.

syntax "extract_lets"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.extractLets]
  Extracts `let` and `have` expressions from within the target or a local hypothesis,
  introducing new local definitions.

  - `extract_lets` extracts all the lets from the target.
  - `extract_lets x y z` extracts all the lets from the target and uses `x`, `y`, and `z` for the first names.
    Using `_` for a name leaves it unnamed.
  - `extract_lets x y z at h` operates on the local hypothesis `h` instead of the target.

  For example, given a local hypotheses if the form `h : let x := v; b x`, then `extract_lets z at h`
  introduces a new local definition `z := v` and changes `h` to be `h : b z`.

syntax "fail"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.fail]
  `fail msg` is a tactic that always fails, and produces an error using the given message.

syntax "fail_if_no_progress"... [Mathlib.Tactic.failIfNoProgress]
  `fail_if_no_progress tacs` evaluates `tacs`, and fails if no progress is made on the main goal
  or the local context at reducible transparency.

syntax "fail_if_success"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.failIfSuccess]
  `fail_if_success t` fails if the tactic `t` succeeds.

syntax "false_or_by_contra"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.falseOrByContra]
  Changes the goal to `False`, retaining as much information as possible:

  * If the goal is `False`, do nothing.
  * If the goal is an implication or a function type, introduce the argument and restart.
    (In particular, if the goal is `x ≠ y`, introduce `x = y`.)
  * Otherwise, for a propositional goal `P`, replace it with `¬ ¬ P`
    (attempting to find a `Decidable` instance, but otherwise falling back to working classically)
    and introduce `¬ P`.
  * For a non-propositional goal use `False.elim`.

syntax "fapply"... [Batteries.Tactic.tacticFapply_]
  `fapply e` is like `apply e` but it adds goals in the order they appear,
  rather than putting the dependent goals first.

syntax "fconstructor"... [tacticFconstructor]
  `fconstructor` is like `constructor`
  (it calls `apply` using the first matching constructor of an inductive datatype)
  except that it does not reorder goals.

syntax "field"... [Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp.field]
  The `field` tactic proves equality goals in (semi-)fields. For example:
  ```
  example {x y : ℚ} (hx : x + y ≠ 0) : x / (x + y) + y / (x + y) = 1 := by
    field
  example {a b : ℝ} (ha : a ≠ 0) : a / (a * b) - 1 / b = 0 := by field
  ```
  The scope of the tactic is equality goals which are *universal*, in the sense that they are true in
  any field in which the appropriate denominators don't vanish. (That is, they are consequences purely
  of the field axioms.)

  Checking the nonvanishing of the necessary denominators is done using a variety of tricks -- in
  particular this part of the reasoning is non-universal, i.e. can be specific to the field at hand
  (order properties, explicit `≠ 0` hypotheses, `CharZero` if that is known, etc).  The user can also
  provide additional terms to help with the nonzeroness proofs. For example:
  ```
  example {K : Type*} [Field K] (hK : ∀ x : K, x ^ 2 + 1 ≠ 0) (x : K) :
      1 / (x ^ 2 + 1) + x ^ 2 / (x ^ 2 + 1) = 1 := by
    field [hK]
  ```

  The `field` tactic is built from the tactics `field_simp` (which clears the denominators) and `ring`
  (which proves equality goals universally true in commutative (semi-)rings). If `field` fails to
  prove your goal, you may still be able to prove your goal by running the `field_simp` and `ring_nf`
  normalizations in some order.  For example, this statement:
  ```
  example {a b : ℚ} (H : b + a ≠ 0) : a / (a + b) + b / (b + a) = 1
  ```
  is not proved by `field` but is proved by `ring_nf at *; field`.

syntax "field_simp"... [Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp.fieldSimp]
  The goal of `field_simp` is to bring expressions in (semi-)fields over a common denominator, i.e. to
  reduce them to expressions of the form `n / d` where neither `n` nor `d` contains any division
  symbol. For example, `x / (1 - y) / (1 + y / (1 - y))` is reduced to `x / (1 - y + y)`:
  ```
  example (x y z : ℚ) (hy : 1 - y ≠ 0) :
      ⌊x / (1 - y) / (1 + y / (1 - y))⌋ < 3 := by
    field_simp
    -- new goal: `⊢ ⌊x / (1 - y + y)⌋ < 3`
  ```

  The `field_simp` tactic will also clear denominators in field *(in)equalities*, by
  cross-multiplying. For example, `field_simp` will clear the `x` denominators in the following
  equation:
  ```
  example {K : Type*} [Field K] {x : K} (hx0 : x ≠ 0) :
      (x + 1 / x) ^ 2 + (x + 1 / x) = 1 := by
    field_simp
    -- new goal: `⊢ (x ^ 2 + 1) * (x ^ 2 + 1 + x) = x ^ 2`
  ```

  A very common pattern is `field_simp; ring` (clear denominators, then the resulting goal is
  solvable by the axioms of a commutative ring). The finishing tactic `field` is a shorthand for this
  pattern.

  Cancelling and combining denominators will generally require checking "nonzeroness"/"positivity"
  side conditions. The `field_simp` tactic attempts to discharge these, and will omit such steps if it
  cannot discharge the corresponding side conditions. The discharger will try, among other things,
  `positivity` and `norm_num`, and will also use any nonzeroness/positivity proofs included explicitly
  (e.g. `field_simp [hx]`). If your expression is not completely reduced by `field_simp`, check the
  denominators of the resulting expression and provide proofs that they are nonzero/positive to enable
  further progress.

syntax "field_simp_discharge"... [Mathlib.Tactic.FieldSimp.tacticField_simp_discharge]
  Discharge strategy for the `field_simp` tactic.

syntax "filter_upwards"... [Mathlib.Tactic.filterUpwards]
  `filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ]` replaces a goal of the form `s ∈ f` and terms
  `h₁ : t₁ ∈ f, ⋯, hₙ : tₙ ∈ f` with `∀ x, x ∈ t₁ → ⋯ → x ∈ tₙ → x ∈ s`.
  The list is an optional parameter, `[]` being its default value.

  `filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ` is a short form for
  `{ filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ], intro a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ }`.

  `filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] using e` is a short form for
  `{ filter_upwards [h1, ⋯, hn], exact e }`.

  Combining both shortcuts is done by writing `filter_upwards [h₁, ⋯, hₙ] with a₁ a₂ ⋯ aₖ using e`.
  Note that in this case, the `aᵢ` terms can be used in `e`.

syntax "fin_cases"... [Lean.Elab.Tactic.finCases]
  `fin_cases h` performs case analysis on a hypothesis of the form
  `h : A`, where `[Fintype A]` is available, or
  `h : a ∈ A`, where `A : Finset X`, `A : Multiset X` or `A : List X`.

  As an example, in
  ```
  example (f : ℕ → Prop) (p : Fin 3) (h0 : f 0) (h1 : f 1) (h2 : f 2) : f p.val := by
    fin_cases p; simp
    all_goals assumption
  ```
  after `fin_cases p; simp`, there are three goals, `f 0`, `f 1`, and `f 2`.

syntax "fin_omega"... [Fin.tacticFin_omega]
  Preprocessor for `omega` to handle inequalities in `Fin`.
  Note that this involves a lot of case splitting, so may be slow.

syntax "find"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Find.tacticFind]
  Display theorems (and definitions) whose result type matches the current goal,
  i.e. which should be `apply`able.
  ```lean
  example : True := by find
  ```
  `find` will not affect the goal by itself and should be removed from the finished proof.
  For a command that takes the type to search for as an argument,
  see `#find`, which is also available as a tactic.

syntax "finiteness"... [finiteness]
  Tactic to solve goals of the form `*** < ∞` and (equivalently) `*** ≠ ∞` in the extended
  nonnegative reals (`ℝ≥0∞`).

syntax "finiteness?"... [finiteness?]
  Tactic to solve goals of the form `*** < ∞` and (equivalently) `*** ≠ ∞` in the extended
  nonnegative reals (`ℝ≥0∞`).

syntax "finiteness_nonterminal"... [finiteness_nonterminal]
  Tactic to solve goals of the form `*** < ∞` and (equivalently) `*** ≠ ∞` in the extended

syntax "first"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.first]
  `first | tac | ...` runs each `tac` until one succeeds, or else fails.

syntax "focus"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.focus]
  `focus tac` focuses on the main goal, suppressing all other goals, and runs `tac` on it.
  Usually `· tac`, which enforces that the goal is closed by `tac`, should be preferred.

syntax "forward"... [Aesop.Frontend.tacticForward___]

syntax "forward?"... [Aesop.Frontend.tacticForward?___]

syntax "frac_tac"... [RatFunc.tacticFrac_tac]
  Solve equations for `RatFunc K` by working in `FractionRing K[X]`.

syntax "fun_cases"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.funCases]
  The `fun_cases` tactic is a convenience wrapper of the `cases` tactic when using a functional
  cases principle.

  The tactic invocation
  ```
  fun_cases f x ... y ...`
  ```
  is equivalent to
  ```
  cases y, ... using f.fun_cases_unfolding x ...
  ```
  where the arguments of `f` are used as arguments to `f.fun_cases_unfolding` or targets of the case
  analysis, as appropriate.

  The form
  ```
  fun_cases f
  ```
  (with no arguments to `f`) searches the goal for a unique eligible application of `f`, and uses
  these arguments. An application of `f` is eligible if it is saturated and the arguments that will
  become targets are free variables.

  The form `fun_cases f x y with | case1 => tac₁ | case2 x' ih => tac₂` works like with `cases`.

  Under `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding true` (the default), `fun_induction` uses the
  `f.fun_cases_unfolding` theorem, which will try to automatically unfold the call to `f` in
  the goal. With `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`, it uses `f.fun_cases` instead.

syntax "fun_induction"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.funInduction]
  The `fun_induction` tactic is a convenience wrapper around the `induction` tactic to use the the
  functional induction principle.

  The tactic invocation
  ```
  fun_induction f x₁ ... xₙ y₁ ... yₘ
  ```
  where `f` is a function defined by non-mutual structural or well-founded recursion, is equivalent to
  ```
  induction y₁, ... yₘ using f.induct_unfolding x₁ ... xₙ
  ```
  where the arguments of `f` are used as arguments to `f.induct_unfolding` or targets of the
  induction, as appropriate.

  The form
  ```
  fun_induction f
  ```
  (with no arguments to `f`) searches the goal for a unique eligible application of `f`, and uses
  these arguments. An application of `f` is eligible if it is saturated and the arguments that will
  become targets are free variables.

  The forms `fun_induction f x y generalizing z₁ ... zₙ` and
  `fun_induction f x y with | case1 => tac₁ | case2 x' ih => tac₂` work like with `induction.`

  Under `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding true` (the default), `fun_induction` uses the
  `f.induct_unfolding` induction principle, which will try to automatically unfold the call to `f` in
  the goal. With `set_option tactic.fun_induction.unfolding false`, it uses `f.induct` instead.

syntax "fun_prop"... [Mathlib.Meta.FunProp.funPropTacStx]
  Tactic to prove function properties

syntax "funext"... [tacticFunext___]
  Apply function extensionality and introduce new hypotheses.
  The tactic `funext` will keep applying the `funext` lemma until the goal target is not reducible to
  ```
    |-  ((fun x => ...) = (fun x => ...))
  ```
  The variant `funext h₁ ... hₙ` applies `funext` `n` times, and uses the given identifiers to name the new hypotheses.
  Patterns can be used like in the `intro` tactic. Example, given a goal
  ```
    |-  ((fun x : Nat × Bool => ...) = (fun x => ...))
  ```
  `funext (a, b)` applies `funext` once and performs pattern matching on the newly introduced pair.

syntax "gcongr"... [Mathlib.Tactic.GCongr.tacticGcongr___With___]
  The `gcongr` tactic applies "generalized congruence" rules, reducing a relational goal
  between an LHS and RHS.  For example,
  ```
  example {a b x c d : ℝ} (h1 : a + 1 ≤ b + 1) (h2 : c + 2 ≤ d + 2) :
      x ^ 2 * a + c ≤ x ^ 2 * b + d := by
    gcongr
    · linarith
    · linarith
  ```
  This example has the goal of proving the relation `≤` between an LHS and RHS both of the pattern
  ```
  x ^ 2 * ?_ + ?_
  ```
  (with inputs `a`, `c` on the left and `b`, `d` on the right); after the use of
  `gcongr`, we have the simpler goals `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d`.

  A depth limit or a pattern can be provided explicitly;
  this is useful if a non-maximal match is desired:
  ```
  example {a b c d x : ℝ} (h : a + c + 1 ≤ b + d + 1) :
      x ^ 2 * (a + c) + 5 ≤ x ^ 2 * (b + d) + 5 := by
    gcongr x ^ 2 * ?_ + 5 -- or `gcongr 2`
    linarith
  ```

  The "generalized congruence" rules are the library lemmas which have been tagged with the
  attribute `@[gcongr]`.  For example, the first example constructs the proof term
  ```
  add_le_add (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left ?_ (Even.pow_nonneg (even_two_mul 1) x)) ?_
  ```
  using the generalized congruence lemmas `add_le_add` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`.

  The tactic attempts to discharge side goals to these "generalized congruence" lemmas (such as the
  side goal `0 ≤ x ^ 2` in the above application of `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`) using the tactic
  `gcongr_discharger`, which wraps `positivity` but can also be extended. Side goals not discharged
  in this way are left for the user.

  `gcongr` will descend into binders (for example sums or suprema). To name the bound variables,
  use `with`:
  ```
  example {f g : ℕ → ℝ≥0∞} (h : ∀ n, f n ≤ g n) : ⨆ n, f n ≤ ⨆ n, g n := by
    gcongr with i
    exact h i
  ```

syntax "generalize"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.generalize]
  * `generalize ([h :] e = x),+` replaces all occurrences `e`s in the main goal
    with a fresh hypothesis `x`s. If `h` is given, `h : e = x` is introduced as well.
  * `generalize e = x at h₁ ... hₙ` also generalizes occurrences of `e`
    inside `h₁`, ..., `hₙ`.
  * `generalize e = x at *` will generalize occurrences of `e` everywhere.

syntax "generalize'"... [«tacticGeneralize'_:_=_»]
  Backwards compatibility shim for `generalize`.

syntax "generalize_proofs"... [Batteries.Tactic.generalizeProofsElab]
  `generalize_proofs ids* [at locs]?` generalizes proofs in the current goal,
  turning them into new local hypotheses.

  - `generalize_proofs` generalizes proofs in the target.
  - `generalize_proofs at h₁ h₂` generalized proofs in hypotheses `h₁` and `h₂`.
  - `generalize_proofs at *` generalizes proofs in the entire local context.
  - `generalize_proofs pf₁ pf₂ pf₃` uses names `pf₁`, `pf₂`, and `pf₃` for the generalized proofs.
    These can be `_` to not name proofs.

  If a proof is already present in the local context, it will use that rather than create a new
  local hypothesis.

  When doing `generalize_proofs at h`, if `h` is a let binding, its value is cleared,
  and furthermore if `h` duplicates a preceding local hypothesis then it is eliminated.

  The tactic is able to abstract proofs from under binders, creating universally quantified
  proofs in the local context.
  To disable this, use `generalize_proofs -abstract`.
  The tactic is also set to recursively abstract proofs from the types of the generalized proofs.
  This can be controlled with the `maxDepth` configuration option,
  with `generalize_proofs (config := { maxDepth := 0 })` turning this feature off.

  For example:
  ```lean
  def List.nthLe {α} (l : List α) (n : ℕ) (_h : n < l.length) : α := sorry
  example : List.nthLe [1, 2] 1 (by simp) = 2 := by
    -- ⊢ [1, 2].nthLe 1 ⋯ = 2
    generalize_proofs h
    -- h : 1 < [1, 2].length
    -- ⊢ [1, 2].nthLe 1 h = 2
  ```

syntax "get_elem_tactic"... [tacticGet_elem_tactic]
  `get_elem_tactic` is the tactic automatically called by the notation `arr[i]`
  to prove any side conditions that arise when constructing the term
  (e.g. the index is in bounds of the array). It just delegates to
  `get_elem_tactic_extensible` and gives a diagnostic error message otherwise;
  users are encouraged to extend `get_elem_tactic_extensible` instead of this tactic.

syntax "get_elem_tactic_extensible"... [tacticGet_elem_tactic_extensible]
  `get_elem_tactic_extensible` is an extensible tactic automatically called
  by the notation `arr[i]` to prove any side conditions that arise when
  constructing the term (e.g. the index is in bounds of the array).
  The default behavior is to try `simp +arith` and `omega`
  (for doing linear arithmetic in the index).

  (Note that the core tactic `get_elem_tactic` has already tried
  `done` and `assumption` before the extensible tactic is called.)

syntax "get_elem_tactic_trivial"... [tacticGet_elem_tactic_trivial]
  `get_elem_tactic_trivial` has been deprecated in favour of `get_elem_tactic_extensible`.

syntax "ghost_calc"... [WittVector.Tactic.ghostCalc]
  `ghost_calc` is a tactic for proving identities between polynomial functions.
  Typically, when faced with a goal like
  ```lean
  ∀ (x y : 𝕎 R), verschiebung (x * frobenius y) = verschiebung x * y
  ```
  you can
  1. call `ghost_calc`
  2. do a small amount of manual work -- maybe nothing, maybe `rintro`, etc
  3. call `ghost_simp`

  and this will close the goal.

  `ghost_calc` cannot detect whether you are dealing with unary or binary polynomial functions.
  You must give it arguments to determine this.
  If you are proving a universally quantified goal like the above,
  call `ghost_calc _ _`.
  If the variables are introduced already, call `ghost_calc x y`.
  In the unary case, use `ghost_calc _` or `ghost_calc x`.

  `ghost_calc` is a light wrapper around type class inference.
  All it does is apply the appropriate extensionality lemma and try to infer the resulting goals.
  This is subtle and Lean's elaborator doesn't like it because of the HO unification involved,
  so it is easier (and prettier) to put it in a tactic script.

syntax "ghost_fun_tac"... [WittVector.«tacticGhost_fun_tac_,_»]
  An auxiliary tactic for proving that `ghostFun` respects the ring operations.

syntax "ghost_simp"... [WittVector.Tactic.ghostSimp]
  A macro for a common simplification when rewriting with ghost component equations.

syntax "grewrite"... [Mathlib.Tactic.grewriteSeq]
  `grewrite [e]` is like `grw [e]`, but it doesn't try to close the goal with `rfl`.
  This is analogous to `rw` and `rewrite`, where `rewrite` doesn't try to close the goal with `rfl`.

syntax "grind"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.grind]
  `grind` is a tactic inspired by modern SMT solvers. **Picture a virtual whiteboard**:
  every time grind discovers a new equality, inequality, or logical fact,
  it writes it on the board, groups together terms known to be equal,
  and lets each reasoning engine read from and contribute to the shared workspace.
  These engines work together to handle equality reasoning, apply known theorems,
  propagate new facts, perform case analysis, and run specialized solvers
  for domains like linear arithmetic and commutative rings.

  `grind` is *not* designed for goals whose search space explodes combinatorially,
  think large pigeonhole instances, graph‑coloring reductions, high‑order N‑queens boards,
  or a 200‑variable Sudoku encoded as Boolean constraints.  Such encodings require
   thousands (or millions) of case‑splits that overwhelm `grind`’s branching search.

  For **bit‑level or combinatorial problems**, consider using **`bv_decide`**.
  `bv_decide` calls a state‑of‑the‑art SAT solver (CaDiCaL) and then returns a
  *compact, machine‑checkable certificate*.

  ### Equality reasoning

  `grind` uses **congruence closure** to track equalities between terms.
  When two terms are known to be equal, congruence closure automatically deduces
  equalities between more complex expressions built from them.
  For example, if `a = b`, then congruence closure will also conclude that `f a` = `f b`
  for any function `f`. This forms the foundation for efficient equality reasoning in `grind`.
  Here is an example:
  ```
  example (f : Nat → Nat) (h : a = b) : f (f b) = f (f a) := by
    grind
  ```

  ### Applying theorems using E-matching

  To apply existing theorems, `grind` uses a technique called **E-matching**,
  which finds matches for known theorem patterns while taking equalities into account.
  Combined with congruence closure, E-matching helps `grind` discover
  non-obvious consequences of theorems and equalities automatically.

  Consider the following functions and theorems:
  ```
  def f (a : Nat) : Nat :=
    a + 1

  def g (a : Nat) : Nat :=
    a - 1

  @[grind =]
  theorem gf (x : Nat) : g (f x) = x := by
    simp [f, g]
  ```
  The theorem `gf` asserts that `g (f x) = x` for all natural numbers `x`.
  The attribute `[grind =]` instructs `grind` to use the left-hand side of the equation,
  `g (f x)`, as a pattern for E-matching.
  Suppose we now have a goal involving:
  ```
  example {a b} (h : f b = a) : g a = b := by
    grind
  ```
  Although `g a` is not an instance of the pattern `g (f x)`,
  it becomes one modulo the equation `f b = a`. By substituting `a`
  with `f b` in `g a`, we obtain the term `g (f b)`,
  which matches the pattern `g (f x)` with the assignment `x := b`.
  Thus, the theorem `gf` is instantiated with `x := b`,
  and the new equality `g (f b) = b` is asserted.
  `grind` then uses congruence closure to derive the implied equality
  `g a = g (f b)` and completes the proof.

  The pattern used to instantiate theorems affects the effectiveness of `grind`.
  For example, the pattern `g (f x)` is too restrictive in the following case:
  the theorem `gf` will not be instantiated because the goal does not even
  contain the function symbol `g`.

  ```
  example (h₁ : f b = a) (h₂ : f c = a) : b = c := by
    grind
  ```

  You can use the command `grind_pattern` to manually select a pattern for a given theorem.
  In the following example, we instruct `grind` to use `f x` as the pattern,
  allowing it to solve the goal automatically:
  ```
  grind_pattern gf => f x

  example {a b c} (h₁ : f b = a) (h₂ : f c = a) : b = c := by
    grind
  ```
  You can enable the option `trace.grind.ematch.instance` to make `grind` print a
  trace message for each theorem instance it generates.

  You can also specify a **multi-pattern** to control when `grind` should apply a theorem.
  A multi-pattern requires that all specified patterns are matched in the current context
  before the theorem is applied. This is useful for theorems such as transitivity rules,
  where multiple premises must be simultaneously present for the rule to apply.
  The following example demonstrates this feature using a transitivity axiom for a binary relation `R`:
  ```
  opaque R : Int → Int → Prop
  axiom Rtrans {x y z : Int} : R x y → R y z → R x z

  grind_pattern Rtrans => R x y, R y z

  example {a b c d} : R a b → R b c → R c d → R a d := by
    grind
  ```
  By specifying the multi-pattern `R x y, R y z`, we instruct `grind` to
  instantiate `Rtrans` only when both `R x y` and `R y z` are available in the context.
  In the example, `grind` applies `Rtrans` to derive `R a c` from `R a b` and `R b c`,
  and can then repeat the same reasoning to deduce `R a d` from `R a c` and `R c d`.

  Instead of using `grind_pattern` to explicitly specify a pattern,
  you can use the `@[grind]` attribute or one of its variants, which will use a heuristic to
  generate a (multi-)pattern. The complete list is available in the reference manual. The main ones are:

  - `@[grind →]` will select a multi-pattern from the hypotheses of the theorem (i.e. it will use the theorem for forwards reasoning).
    In more detail, it will traverse the hypotheses of the theorem from left-to-right, and each time it encounters a minimal indexable
    (i.e. has a constant as its head) subexpression which "covers" (i.e. fixes the value of) an argument which was not
    previously covered, it will add that subexpression as a pattern, until all arguments have been covered.
  - `@[grind ←]` will select a multi-pattern from the conclusion of theorem (i.e. it will use the theorem for backwards reasoning).
    This may fail if not all the arguments to the theorem appear in the conclusion.
  - `@[grind]` will traverse the conclusion and then the hypotheses left-to-right, adding patterns as they increase the coverage,
    stopping when all arguments are covered.
  - `@[grind =]` checks that the conclusion of the theorem is an equality, and then uses the left-hand-side of the equality as a pattern.
    This may fail if not all of the arguments appear in the left-hand-side.

  Here is the previous example again but using the attribute `[grind →]`
  ```
  opaque R : Int → Int → Prop
  @[grind →] axiom Rtrans {x y z : Int} : R x y → R y z → R x z

  example {a b c d} : R a b → R b c → R c d → R a d := by
    grind
  ```

  To control theorem instantiation and avoid generating an unbounded number of instances,
  `grind` uses a generation counter. Terms in the original goal are assigned generation zero.
  When `grind` applies a theorem using terms of generation `≤ n`, any new terms it creates
  are assigned generation `n + 1`. This limits how far the tactic explores when applying
  theorems and helps prevent an excessive number of instantiations.

  #### Key options:
  - `grind (ematch := <num>)` controls the number of E-matching rounds.
  - `grind [<name>, ...]` instructs `grind` to use the declaration `name` during E-matching.
  - `grind only [<name>, ...]` is like `grind [<name>, ...]` but does not use theorems tagged with `@[grind]`.
  - `grind (gen := <num>)` sets the maximum generation.

  ### Linear integer arithmetic (`cutsat`)

  `grind` can solve goals that reduce to **linear integer arithmetic (LIA)** using an
  integrated decision procedure called **`cutsat`**.  It understands

  * equalities   `p = 0`
  * inequalities  `p ≤ 0`
  * disequalities `p ≠ 0`
  * divisibility  `d ∣ p`

  The solver incrementally assigns integer values to variables; when a partial
  assignment violates a constraint it adds a new, implied constraint and retries.
  This *model-based* search is **complete for LIA**.

  #### Key options:

  * `grind -cutsat` disable the solver (useful for debugging)
  * `grind +qlia` accept rational models (shrinks the search space but is incomplete for ℤ)

  #### Examples:

  ```
  -- Even + even is never odd.
  example {x y : Int} : 2 * x + 4 * y ≠ 5 := by
    grind

  -- Mixing equalities and inequalities.
  example {x y : Int} :
      2 * x + 3 * y = 0 → 1 ≤ x → y < 1 := by
    grind

  -- Reasoning with divisibility.
  example (a b : Int) :
      2 ∣ a + 1 → 2 ∣ b + a → ¬ 2 ∣ b + 2 * a := by
    grind

  example (x y : Int) :
      27 ≤ 11*x + 13*y →
      11*x + 13*y ≤ 45 →
      -10 ≤ 7*x - 9*y →
      7*x - 9*y ≤ 4 → False := by
    grind

  -- Types that implement the `ToInt` type-class.
  example (a b c : UInt64)
      : a ≤ 2 → b ≤ 3 → c - a - b = 0 → c ≤ 5 := by
    grind
  ```

  ### Algebraic solver (`ring`)

  `grind` ships with an algebraic solver nick-named **`ring`** for goals that can
  be phrased as polynomial equations (or disequations) over commutative rings,
  semirings, or fields.

  *Works out of the box*
  All core numeric types and relevant Mathlib types already provide the required
  type-class instances, so the solver is ready to use in most developments.

  What it can decide:

  * equalities of the form `p = q`
  * disequalities `p ≠ q`
  * basic reasoning under field inverses (`a / b := a * b⁻¹`)
  * goals that mix ring facts with other `grind` engines

  #### Key options:

  * `grind -ring` turn the solver off (useful when debugging)
  * `grind (ringSteps := n)` cap the number of steps performed by this procedure.

  #### Examples

  ```
  open Lean Grind

  example [CommRing α] (x : α) : (x + 1) * (x - 1) = x^2 - 1 := by
    grind

  -- Characteristic 256 means 16 * 16 = 0.
  example [CommRing α] [IsCharP α 256] (x : α) :

  example (x : UInt8) : (x + 16) * (x - 16) = x^2 := by
    grind

  example [CommRing α] (a b c : α) :
      a + b + c = 3 →
      a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 5 →
      a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 7 →
      a^4 + b^4 = 9 - c^4 := by
    grind

  example [Field α] [NoNatZeroDivisors α] (a : α) :
      1 / a + 1 / (2 * a) = 3 / (2 * a) := by
    grind
  ```

  ### Other options

  - `grind (splits := <num>)` caps the *depth* of the search tree.  Once a branch performs `num` splits
    `grind` stops splitting further in that branch.
  - `grind -splitIte` disables case splitting on if-then-else expressions.
  - `grind -splitMatch` disables case splitting on `match` expressions.
  - `grind +splitImp` instructs `grind` to split on any hypothesis `A → B` whose antecedent `A` is **propositional**.
  - `grind -linarith` disables the linear arithmetic solver for (ordered) modules and rings.

  ### Additional Examples

  ```
  example {a b} {as bs : List α} : (as ++ bs ++ [b]).getLastD a = b := by
    grind

  example (x : BitVec (w+1)) : (BitVec.cons x.msb (x.setWidth w)) = x := by
    grind

  example (as : Array α) (lo hi i j : Nat) :
      lo ≤ i → i < j → j ≤ hi → j < as.size → min lo (as.size - 1) ≤ i := by
    grind
  ```

syntax "grind?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.grindTrace]
  `grind?` takes the same arguments as `grind`, but reports an equivalent call to `grind only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the `grind`
  theorems in a local invocation.

syntax "grobner"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.grobner]
  `grobner` solves goals that can be phrased as polynomial equations (with further polynomial equations as hypotheses)
  over commutative (semi)rings, using the Grobner basis algorithm.

  It is a implemented as a thin wrapper around the `grind` tactic, enabling only the `grobner` solver.
  Please use `grind` instead if you need additional capabilities.

syntax "group"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Group.group]
  Tactic for normalizing expressions in multiplicative groups, without assuming
  commutativity, using only the group axioms without any information about which group
  is manipulated.

  (For additive commutative groups, use the `abel` tactic instead.)

  Example:
  ```lean
  example {G : Type} [Group G] (a b c d : G) (h : c = (a*b^2)*((b*b)⁻¹*a⁻¹)*d) : a*c*d⁻¹ = a := by
    group at h -- normalizes `h` which becomes `h : c = d`
    rw [h]     -- the goal is now `a*d*d⁻¹ = a`
    group      -- which then normalized and closed
  ```

syntax "grw"... [Mathlib.Tactic.grwSeq]
  `grw [e]` works just like `rw [e]`, but `e` can be a relation other than `=` or `↔`.

  For example,
  ```lean
  variable {a b c d n : ℤ}

  example (h₁ : a < b) (h₂ : b ≤ c) : a + d ≤ c + d := by
    grw [h₁, h₂]

  example (h : a ≡ b [ZMOD n]) : a ^ 2 ≡ b ^ 2 [ZMOD n] := by
    grw [h]

  example (h₁ : a ∣ b) (h₂ : b ∣ a ^ 2 * c) : a ∣ b ^ 2 * c := by
    grw [h₁] at *
    exact h₂
  ```
  To rewrite only in the `n`-th position, use `nth_grw n`.
  This is useful when `grw` tries to rewrite in a position that is not valid for the given relation.

  To be able to use `grw`, the relevant lemmas need to be tagged with `@[gcongr]`.
  To rewrite inside a transitive relation, you can also give it an `IsTrans` instance.

  To let `grw` unfold more aggressively, as in `erw`, use `grw (transparency := default)`.

syntax "guard_expr"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.guardExpr]
  Tactic to check equality of two expressions.
  * `guard_expr e = e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at reducible transparency.
  * `guard_expr e =~ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are defeq at default transparency.
  * `guard_expr e =ₛ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are syntactically equal.
  * `guard_expr e =ₐ e'` checks that `e` and `e'` are alpha-equivalent.

  Both `e` and `e'` are elaborated then have their metavariables instantiated before the equality
  check. Their types are unified (using `isDefEqGuarded`) before synthetic metavariables are
  processed, which helps with default instance handling.

syntax "guard_goal_nums"... [guardGoalNums]
  `guard_goal_nums n` succeeds if there are exactly `n` goals and fails otherwise.

syntax "guard_hyp"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.guardHyp]
  Tactic to check that a named hypothesis has a given type and/or value.

  * `guard_hyp h : t` checks the type up to reducible defeq,
  * `guard_hyp h :~ t` checks the type up to default defeq,
  * `guard_hyp h :ₛ t` checks the type up to syntactic equality,
  * `guard_hyp h :ₐ t` checks the type up to alpha equality.
  * `guard_hyp h := v` checks value up to reducible defeq,
  * `guard_hyp h :=~ v` checks value up to default defeq,
  * `guard_hyp h :=ₛ v` checks value up to syntactic equality,
  * `guard_hyp h :=ₐ v` checks the value up to alpha equality.

  The value `v` is elaborated using the type of `h` as the expected type.

syntax "guard_hyp_nums"... [guardHypNums]
  `guard_hyp_nums n` succeeds if there are exactly `n` hypotheses and fails otherwise.

  Note that, depending on what options are set, some hypotheses in the local context might
  not be printed in the goal view. This tactic computes the total number of hypotheses,
  not the number of visible hypotheses.

syntax "guard_target"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.guardTarget]
  Tactic to check that the target agrees with a given expression.
  * `guard_target = e` checks that the target is defeq at reducible transparency to `e`.
  * `guard_target =~ e` checks that the target is defeq at default transparency to `e`.
  * `guard_target =ₛ e` checks that the target is syntactically equal to `e`.
  * `guard_target =ₐ e` checks that the target is alpha-equivalent to `e`.

  The term `e` is elaborated with the type of the goal as the expected type, which is mostly
  useful within `conv` mode.

syntax "have"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticHave_]
  The `have` tactic is for adding opaque definitions and hypotheses to the local context of the main goal.
  The definitions forget their associated value and cannot be unfolded, unlike definitions added by the `let` tactic.

  * `have h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
  * `have h := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
  * `have : t := e` and `have := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
  * `have pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
    where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
    It is convenient for types that have only one applicable constructor.
    For example, given `h : p ∧ q ∧ r`, `have ⟨h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ := h` produces the
    hypotheses `h₁ : p`, `h₂ : q`, and `h₃ : r`.
  * The syntax `have (eq := h) pat := e` is equivalent to `match h : e with | pat => _`,
    which adds the equation `h : e = pat` to the local context.

  The tactic supports all the same syntax variants and options as the `have` term.

  ## Properties and relations

  * It is not possible to unfold a variable introduced using `have`, since the definition's value is forgotten.
    The `let` tactic introduces definitions that can be unfolded.
  * The `have h : t := e` is like doing `let h : t := e; clear_value h`.
  * The `have` tactic is preferred for propositions, and `let` is preferred for non-propositions.
  * Sometimes `have` is used for non-propositions to ensure that the variable is never unfolded,
    which may be important for performance reasons.
      Consider using the equivalent `let +nondep` to indicate the intent.

syntax "have"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticHave__]
  The `have` tactic is for adding opaque definitions and hypotheses to the local context of the main goal.
  The definitions forget their associated value and cannot be unfolded, unlike definitions added by the `let` tactic.

  * `have h : t := e` adds the hypothesis `h : t` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
  * `have h := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
  * `have : t := e` and `have := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
  * `have pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
    where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
    It is convenient for types that have only one applicable constructor.
    For example, given `h : p ∧ q ∧ r`, `have ⟨h₁, h₂, h₃⟩ := h` produces the
    hypotheses `h₁ : p`, `h₂ : q`, and `h₃ : r`.
  * The syntax `have (eq := h) pat := e` is equivalent to `match h : e with | pat => _`,
    which adds the equation `h : e = pat` to the local context.

    which may be important for performance reasons.
      Consider using the equivalent `let +nondep` to indicate the intent.

syntax "have'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticHave']
  Similar to `have`, but using `refine'`

syntax "haveI"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticHaveI__]
  `haveI` behaves like `have`, but inlines the value instead of producing a `have` term.

syntax "hint"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Hint.hintStx]
  The `hint` tactic tries every tactic registered using `register_hint <prio> tac`,
  and reports any that succeed.

syntax "induction"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.induction]
  Assuming `x` is a variable in the local context with an inductive type,
  `induction x` applies induction on `x` to the main goal,
  producing one goal for each constructor of the inductive type,
  in which the target is replaced by a general instance of that constructor
  and an inductive hypothesis is added for each recursive argument to the constructor.
  If the type of an element in the local context depends on `x`,
  that element is reverted and reintroduced afterward,
  so that the inductive hypothesis incorporates that hypothesis as well.

  For example, given `n : Nat` and a goal with a hypothesis `h : P n` and target `Q n`,
  `induction n` produces one goal with hypothesis `h : P 0` and target `Q 0`,
  and one goal with hypotheses `h : P (Nat.succ a)` and `ih₁ : P a → Q a` and target `Q (Nat.succ a)`.
  Here the names `a` and `ih₁` are chosen automatically and are not accessible.
  You can use `with` to provide the variables names for each constructor.
  - `induction e`, where `e` is an expression instead of a variable,
    generalizes `e` in the goal, and then performs induction on the resulting variable.
  - `induction e using r` allows the user to specify the principle of induction that should be used.
    Here `r` should be a term whose result type must be of the form `C t`,
    where `C` is a bound variable and `t` is a (possibly empty) sequence of bound variables
  - `induction e generalizing z₁ ... zₙ`, where `z₁ ... zₙ` are variables in the local context,
    generalizes over `z₁ ... zₙ` before applying the induction but then introduces them in each goal.
    In other words, the net effect is that each inductive hypothesis is generalized.
  - Given `x : Nat`, `induction x with | zero => tac₁ | succ x' ih => tac₂`
    uses tactic `tac₁` for the `zero` case, and `tac₂` for the `succ` case.

syntax "induction'"... [Mathlib.Tactic.induction']
  The `induction'` tactic is similar to the `induction` tactic in Lean 4 core,
  but with slightly different syntax (such as, no requirement to name the constructors).

  ```
  open Nat

  example (n : ℕ) : 0 < factorial n := by
    induction' n with n ih
    · rw [factorial_zero]
      simp
    · rw [factorial_succ]
      apply mul_pos (succ_pos n) ih

  example (n : ℕ) : 0 < factorial n := by
    induction n
    case zero =>
      rw [factorial_zero]
      simp
    case succ n ih =>
      rw [factorial_succ]
      apply mul_pos (succ_pos n) ih
  ```

syntax "infer_instance"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticInfer_instance]
  `infer_instance` is an abbreviation for `exact inferInstance`.
  It synthesizes a value of any target type by typeclass inference.

syntax "infer_param"... [Mathlib.Tactic.inferOptParam]
  Close a goal of the form `optParam α a` or `autoParam α stx` by using `a`.

syntax "inhabit"... [Lean.Elab.Tactic.inhabit]
  `inhabit α` tries to derive a `Nonempty α` instance and
  then uses it to make an `Inhabited α` instance.
  If the target is a `Prop`, this is done constructively. Otherwise, it uses `Classical.choice`.

syntax "init_ring"... [WittVector.initRing]
  `init_ring` is an auxiliary tactic that discharges goals factoring `init` over ring operations.

syntax "injection"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.injection]
  The `injection` tactic is based on the fact that constructors of inductive data
  types are injections.
  That means that if `c` is a constructor of an inductive datatype, and if `(c t₁)`
  and `(c t₂)` are two terms that are equal then  `t₁` and `t₂` are equal too.
  If `q` is a proof of a statement of conclusion `t₁ = t₂`, then injection applies
  injectivity to derive the equality of all arguments of `t₁` and `t₂` placed in
  the same positions. For example, from `(a::b) = (c::d)` we derive `a=c` and `b=d`.
  To use this tactic `t₁` and `t₂` should be constructor applications of the same constructor.
  Given `h : a::b = c::d`, the tactic `injection h` adds two new hypothesis with types
  `a = c` and `b = d` to the main goal.
  The tactic `injection h with h₁ h₂` uses the names `h₁` and `h₂` to name the new hypotheses.

syntax "injections"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.injections]
  `injections` applies `injection` to all hypotheses recursively
  (since `injection` can produce new hypotheses). Useful for destructing nested
  constructor equalities like `(a::b::c) = (d::e::f)`.

syntax "interval_cases"... [Mathlib.Tactic.intervalCases]
  `interval_cases n` searches for upper and lower bounds on a variable `n`,
  and if bounds are found,
  splits into separate cases for each possible value of `n`.

  As an example, in
  ```
  example (n : ℕ) (w₁ : n ≥ 3) (w₂ : n < 5) : n = 3 ∨ n = 4 := by
    interval_cases n
    all_goals simp
  ```
  after `interval_cases n`, the goals are `3 = 3 ∨ 3 = 4` and `4 = 3 ∨ 4 = 4`.

  You can also explicitly specify a lower and upper bound to use,
  as `interval_cases using hl, hu`.
  The hypotheses should be in the form `hl : a ≤ n` and `hu : n < b`,
  in which case `interval_cases` calls `fin_cases` on the resulting fact `n ∈ Set.Ico a b`.

  You can specify a name `h` for the new hypothesis,
  as `interval_cases h : n` or `interval_cases h : n using hl, hu`.

syntax "intro"... [Batteries.Tactic.introDot]
  The syntax `intro.` is deprecated in favor of `nofun`.

syntax "intro"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.intro]
  Introduces one or more hypotheses, optionally naming and/or pattern-matching them.
  For each hypothesis to be introduced, the remaining main goal's target type must
  be a `let` or function type.

  * `intro` by itself introduces one anonymous hypothesis, which can be accessed
    by e.g. `assumption`. It is equivalent to `intro _`.
  * `intro x y` introduces two hypotheses and names them. Individual hypotheses
    can be anonymized via `_`, given a type ascription, or matched against a pattern:
    ```lean
    -- ... ⊢ α × β → ...
    intro (a, b)
    -- ..., a : α, b : β ⊢ ...
    ```
  * `intro rfl` is short for `intro h; subst h`, if `h` is an equality where the left-hand or right-hand side
    is a variable.
  * Alternatively, `intro` can be combined with pattern matching much like `fun`:
    ```lean
    intro
    | n + 1, 0 => tac
    | ...
    ```

syntax "intro"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.introMatch]
  The tactic
  ```
  intro
  | pat1 => tac1
  | pat2 => tac2
  ```
  is the same as:
  ```
  intro x
  match x with
  | pat1 => tac1
  | pat2 => tac2
  ```
  That is, `intro` can be followed by match arms and it introduces the values while
  doing a pattern match. This is equivalent to `fun` with match arms in term mode.

syntax "intros"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.intros]
  `intros` repeatedly applies `intro` to introduce zero or more hypotheses
  until the goal is no longer a *binding expression*
  (i.e., a universal quantifier, function type, implication, or `have`/`let`),
  without performing any definitional reductions (no unfolding, beta, eta, etc.).
  The introduced hypotheses receive inaccessible (hygienic) names.

  `intros x y z` is equivalent to `intro x y z` and exists only for historical reasons.
  The `intro` tactic should be preferred in this case.

  ## Properties and relations

  - `intros` succeeds even when it introduces no hypotheses.

  - `repeat intro` is like `intros`, but it performs definitional reductions
    to expose binders, and as such it may introduce more hypotheses than `intros`.

  - `intros` is equivalent to `intro _ _ … _`,
    with the fewest trailing `_` placeholders needed so that the goal is no longer a binding expression.
    The trailing introductions do not perform any definitional reductions.

  ## Examples

  Implications:
  ```lean
  example (p q : Prop) : p → q → p := by
    intros
```
 Tactic state
       a✝¹ : p
       a✝ : q
       ⊢ p      
```lean
assumption
  ```

  Let-bindings:
  ```lean
  example : let n := 1; let k := 2; n + k = 3 := by
    intros
```
 n✝ : Nat := 1
       k✝ : Nat := 2
       ⊢ n✝ + k✝ = 3 
```lean
rfl
  ```

  Does not unfold definitions:
  ```lean
  def AllEven (f : Nat → Nat) := ∀ n, f n % 2 = 0

  example : ∀ (f : Nat → Nat), AllEven f → AllEven (fun k => f (k + 1)) := by
    intros
```
 Tactic state
       f✝ : Nat → Nat
       a✝ : AllEven f✝
       ⊢ AllEven fun k => f✝ (k + 1) 
```lean
sorry
  ```

syntax "introv"... [Mathlib.Tactic.introv]
  The tactic `introv` allows the user to automatically introduce the variables of a theorem and
  explicitly name the non-dependent hypotheses.
  Any dependent hypotheses are assigned their default names.

  Examples:
  ```
  example : ∀ a b : Nat, a = b → b = a := by
    introv h,
    exact h.symm
  ```
  The state after `introv h` is
  ```
  a b : ℕ,
  h : a = b
  ⊢ b = a
  ```

  ```
  example : ∀ a b : Nat, a = b → ∀ c, b = c → a = c := by
    introv h₁ h₂,
    exact h₁.trans h₂
  ```
  The state after `introv h₁ h₂` is
  ```
  a b : ℕ,
  h₁ : a = b,
  c : ℕ,
  h₂ : b = c
  ⊢ a = c
  ```

syntax "isBoundedDefault"... [Filter.tacticIsBoundedDefault]
  Filters are automatically bounded or cobounded in complete lattices. To use the same statements
  in complete and conditionally complete lattices but let automation fill automatically the
  boundedness proofs in complete lattices, we use the tactic `isBoundedDefault` in the statements,
  in the form `(hf : f.IsBounded (≥) := by isBoundedDefault)`.

syntax "itauto"... [Mathlib.Tactic.ITauto.itauto]
  A decision procedure for intuitionistic propositional logic. Unlike `finish` and `tauto!` this
  tactic never uses the law of excluded middle (without the `!` option), and the proof search is
  tailored for this use case. (`itauto!` will work as a classical SAT solver, but the algorithm is
  not very good in this situation.)

  ```lean
  example (p : Prop) : ¬ (p ↔ ¬ p) := by itauto
  ```

  `itauto [a, b]` will additionally attempt case analysis on `a` and `b` assuming that it can derive
  `Decidable a` and `Decidable b`. `itauto *` will case on all decidable propositions that it can
  find among the atomic propositions, and `itauto! *` will case on all propositional atoms.
  *Warning:* This can blow up the proof search, so it should be used sparingly.

syntax "itauto!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.ITauto.itauto!]
  A decision procedure for intuitionistic propositional logic. Unlike `finish` and `tauto!` this
  tactic never uses the law of excluded middle (without the `!` option), and the proof search is
  tailored for this use case. (`itauto!` will work as a classical SAT solver, but the algorithm is
  not very good in this situation.)

  ```lean
  example (p : Prop) : ¬ (p ↔ ¬ p) := by itauto
  ```

  `itauto [a, b]` will additionally attempt case analysis on `a` and `b` assuming that it can derive
  `Decidable a` and `Decidable b`. `itauto *` will case on all decidable propositions that it can
  find among the atomic propositions, and `itauto! *` will case on all propositional atoms.
  *Warning:* This can blow up the proof search, so it should be used sparingly.

syntax "iterate"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticIterate____]
  `iterate n tac` runs `tac` exactly `n` times.
  `iterate tac` runs `tac` repeatedly until failure.

  `iterate`'s argument is a tactic sequence,
  so multiple tactics can be run using `iterate n (tac₁; tac₂; ⋯)` or
  ```lean
  iterate n
    tac₁
    tac₂
    ⋯
  ```

syntax "left"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.left]
  Applies the first constructor when
  the goal is an inductive type with exactly two constructors, or fails otherwise.
  ```
  example : True ∨ False := by
    left
    trivial
  ```

syntax "let"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticLet__]
  The `let` tactic is for adding definitions to the local context of the main goal.
  The definition can be unfolded, unlike definitions introduced by `have`.

  * `let x : t := e` adds the definition `x : t := e` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
  * `let x := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
  * `let : t := e` and `let := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
  * `let pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
    where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
    It is convenient for types that let only one applicable constructor.
    For example, given `p : α × β × γ`, `let ⟨x, y, z⟩ := p` produces the
    local variables `x : α`, `y : β`, and `z : γ`.
  * The syntax `let (eq := h) pat := e` is equivalent to `match h : e with | pat => _`,
    which adds the equation `h : e = pat` to the local context.

  The tactic supports all the same syntax variants and options as the `let` term.

  ## Properties and relations

  * Unlike `have`, it is possible to unfold definitions introduced using `let`, using tactics
    such as `simp`, `dsimp`, `unfold`, and `subst`.
  * The `clear_value` tactic turns a `let` definition into a `have` definition after the fact.
    The tactic might fail if the local context depends on the value of the variable.
  * The `let` tactic is preferred for data (non-propositions).
  * Sometimes `have` is used for non-propositions to ensure that the variable is never unfolded,
    which may be important for performance reasons.

syntax "let"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.letrec]
  `let rec f : t := e` adds a recursive definition `f` to the current goal.
  The syntax is the same as term-mode `let rec`.

syntax "let"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticLet_]
  The `let` tactic is for adding definitions to the local context of the main goal.
  The definition can be unfolded, unlike definitions introduced by `have`.

  * `let x : t := e` adds the definition `x : t := e` if `e` is a term of type `t`.
  * `let x := e` uses the type of `e` for `t`.
  * `let : t := e` and `let := e` use `this` for the name of the hypothesis.
  * `let pat := e` for a pattern `pat` is equivalent to `match e with | pat => _`,
    where `_` stands for the tactics that follow this one.
    It is convenient for types that let only one applicable constructor.
    For example, given `p : α × β × γ`, `let ⟨x, y, z⟩ := p` produces the
    local variables `x : α`, `y : β`, and `z : γ`.
  * The syntax `let (eq := h) pat := e` is equivalent to `match h : e with | pat => _`,
    which adds the equation `h : e = pat` to the local context.

  The tactic supports all the same syntax variants and options as the `let` term.

syntax "let'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticLet'__]
  Similar to `let`, but using `refine'`

syntax "letI"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticLetI__]
  `letI` behaves like `let`, but inlines the value instead of producing a `let` term.

syntax "let_to_have"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.letToHave]
  Transforms `let` expressions into `have` expressions when possible.
  - `let_to_have` transforms `let`s in the target.
  - `let_to_have at h` transforms `let`s in the given local hypothesis.

syntax "lia"... [tacticLia]
  `lia` is an alias for the `cutsat` tactic, which solves linear integer arithmetic goals.

syntax "lift"... [Mathlib.Tactic.lift]
  Lift an expression to another type.
  * Usage: `'lift' expr 'to' expr ('using' expr)? ('with' id (id id?)?)?`.
  * If `n : ℤ` and `hn : n ≥ 0` then the tactic `lift n to ℕ using hn` creates a new
    constant of type `ℕ`, also named `n` and replaces all occurrences of the old variable `(n : ℤ)`
    with `↑n` (where `n` in the new variable). It will clear `n` from the context and
    try to clear `hn` from the context.
    + So for example the tactic `lift n to ℕ using hn` transforms the goal
      `n : ℤ, hn : n ≥ 0, h : P n ⊢ n = 3` to `n : ℕ, h : P ↑n ⊢ ↑n = 3`
      (here `P` is some term of type `ℤ → Prop`).
  * The argument `using hn` is optional, the tactic `lift n to ℕ` does the same, but also creates a
    new subgoal that `n ≥ 0` (where `n` is the old variable).
    This subgoal will be placed at the top of the goal list.
    + So for example the tactic `lift n to ℕ` transforms the goal
      `n : ℤ, h : P n ⊢ n = 3` to two goals
      `n : ℤ, h : P n ⊢ n ≥ 0` and `n : ℕ, h : P ↑n ⊢ ↑n = 3`.
  * You can also use `lift n to ℕ using e` where `e` is any expression of type `n ≥ 0`.
  * Use `lift n to ℕ with k` to specify the name of the new variable.
  * Use `lift n to ℕ with k hk` to also specify the name of the equality `↑k = n`. In this case, `n`
    will remain in the context. You can use `rfl` for the name of `hk` to substitute `n` away
    (i.e. the default behavior).
  * You can also use `lift e to ℕ with k hk` where `e` is any expression of type `ℤ`.
    In this case, the `hk` will always stay in the context, but it will be used to rewrite `e` in
    all hypotheses and the target.
    + So for example the tactic `lift n + 3 to ℕ using hn with k hk` transforms the goal
      `n : ℤ, hn : n + 3 ≥ 0, h : P (n + 3) ⊢ n + 3 = 2 * n` to the goal
      `n : ℤ, k : ℕ, hk : ↑k = n + 3, h : P ↑k ⊢ ↑k = 2 * n`.
  * The tactic `lift n to ℕ using h` will remove `h` from the context. If you want to keep it,
    specify it again as the third argument to `with`, like this: `lift n to ℕ using h with n rfl h`.
  * More generally, this can lift an expression from `α` to `β` assuming that there is an instance
    of `CanLift α β`. In this case the proof obligation is specified by `CanLift.prf`.
  * Given an instance `CanLift β γ`, it can also lift `α → β` to `α → γ`; more generally, given
    `β : Π a : α, Type*`, `γ : Π a : α, Type*`, and `[Π a : α, CanLift (β a) (γ a)]`, it
    automatically generates an instance `CanLift (Π a, β a) (Π a, γ a)`.

  `lift` is in some sense dual to the `zify` tactic. `lift (z : ℤ) to ℕ` will change the type of an
  integer `z` (in the supertype) to `ℕ` (the subtype), given a proof that `z ≥ 0`;
  propositions concerning `z` will still be over `ℤ`. `zify` changes propositions about `ℕ` (the
  subtype) to propositions about `ℤ` (the supertype), without changing the type of any variable.

syntax "lift_lets"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.liftLets]
  Lifts `let` and `have` expressions within a term as far out as possible.
  It is like `extract_lets +lift`, but the top-level lets at the end of the procedure
  are not extracted as local hypotheses.

  - `lift_lets` lifts let expressions in the target.
  - `lift_lets at h` lifts let expressions at the given local hypothesis.

  For example,
  ```lean
  example : (let x := 1; x) = 1 := by
    lift_lets
    -- ⊢ let x := 1; x = 1
    ...
  ```

syntax "liftable_prefixes"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Coherence.liftable_prefixes]
  Internal tactic used in `coherence`.

  Rewrites an equation `f = g` as `f₀ ≫ f₁ = g₀ ≫ g₁`,
  where `f₀` and `g₀` are maximal prefixes of `f` and `g` (possibly after reassociating)
  which are "liftable" (i.e. expressible as compositions of unitors and associators).

syntax "linarith"... [Mathlib.Tactic.linarith]
  `linarith` attempts to find a contradiction between hypotheses that are linear (in)equalities.
  Equivalently, it can prove a linear inequality by assuming its negation and proving `False`.

  In theory, `linarith` should prove any goal that is true in the theory of linear arithmetic over
  the rationals. While there is some special handling for non-dense orders like `Nat` and `Int`,
  this tactic is not complete for these theories and will not prove every true goal. It will solve
  goals over arbitrary types that instantiate `CommRing`, `LinearOrder` and `IsStrictOrderedRing`.

  An example:
  ```lean
  example (x y z : ℚ) (h1 : 2*x < 3*y) (h2 : -4*x + 2*z < 0)
          (h3 : 12*y - 4* z < 0) : False := by
    linarith
  ```

  `linarith` will use all appropriate hypotheses and the negation of the goal, if applicable.
  Disequality hypotheses require case splitting and are not normally considered
  (see the `splitNe` option below).

  `linarith [t1, t2, t3]` will additionally use proof terms `t1, t2, t3`.

  `linarith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only the goal (if relevant), local hypotheses
  `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

  `linarith!` will use a stronger reducibility setting to try to identify atoms. For example,
  ```lean
  example (x : ℚ) : id x ≥ x := by
    linarith
  ```
  will fail, because `linarith` will not identify `x` and `id x`. `linarith!` will.
  This can sometimes be expensive.

  `linarith (config := { .. })` takes a config object with five
  optional arguments:
  * `discharger` specifies a tactic to be used for reducing an algebraic equation in the
    proof stage. The default is `ring`. Other options include `simp` for basic
    problems.
  * `transparency` controls how hard `linarith` will try to match atoms to each other. By default
    it will only unfold `reducible` definitions.
  * If `splitHypotheses` is true, `linarith` will split conjunctions in the context into separate
    hypotheses.
  * If `splitNe` is `true`, `linarith` will case split on disequality hypotheses.
    For a given `x ≠ y` hypothesis, `linarith` is run with both `x < y` and `x > y`,
    and so this runs linarith exponentially many times with respect to the number of
    disequality hypotheses. (`false` by default.)
  * If `exfalso` is `false`, `linarith` will fail when the goal is neither an inequality nor `False`.
    (`true` by default.)
  * If `minimize` is `false`, `linarith?` will report all hypotheses appearing in its initial
    proof without attempting to drop redundancies. (`true` by default.)
  * `restrict_type` (not yet implemented in mathlib4)
    will only use hypotheses that are inequalities over `tp`. This is useful
    if you have e.g. both integer- and rational-valued inequalities in the local context, which can
    sometimes confuse the tactic.

  A variant, `nlinarith`, does some basic preprocessing to handle some nonlinear goals.

  The option `set_option trace.linarith true` will trace certain intermediate stages of the `linarith`
  routine.

syntax "linear_combination"... [Mathlib.Tactic.LinearCombination.linearCombination]
  The `linear_combination` tactic attempts to prove an (in)equality goal by exhibiting it as a
  specified linear combination of (in)equality hypotheses, or other (in)equality proof terms, modulo
  (A) moving terms between the LHS and RHS of the (in)equalities, and (B) a normalization tactic
  which by default is ring-normalization.

  Example usage:
  ```
  example {a b : ℚ} (h1 : a = 1) (h2 : b = 3) : (a + b) / 2 = 2 := by
    linear_combination (h1 + h2) / 2

      2 • x = 2 • (8 • z) := by
    linear_combination (norm := abel) h1 + h2

  example (x y : ℤ) (h1 : x * y + 2 * x = 1) (h2 : x = y) :
      x * y = -2 * y + 1 := by
    linear_combination (norm := ring_nf) -2 * h2
    -- leaves goal `⊢ x * y + x * 2 - 1 = 0`
  ```

  The input `e` in `linear_combination e` is a linear combination of proofs of (in)equalities,
  given as a sum/difference of coefficients multiplied by expressions.
  The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions (with nonnegativity constraints in the case of
  inequalities).
  The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving (in)equalities;
  most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1`, `h2`, ....

  The left and right sides of all the (in)equalities should have the same type `α`, and the
  coefficients should also have type `α`.  For full functionality `α` should be a commutative ring --
  strictly speaking, a commutative semiring with "cancellative" addition (in the semiring case,
  negation and subtraction will be handled "formally" as if operating in the enveloping ring). If a
  nonstandard normalization is used (for example `abel` or `skip`), the tactic will work over types
  `α` with less algebraic structure: for equalities, the minimum is instances of
  `[Add α] [IsRightCancelAdd α]` together with instances of whatever operations are used in the tactic
  call.

  The variant `linear_combination (norm := tac) e` specifies explicitly the "normalization tactic"
  `tac` to be run on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
  * The default normalization tactic is `ring1` (for equalities) or `Mathlib.Tactic.Ring.prove{LE,LT}`
    (for inequalities). These are finishing tactics: they close the goal or fail.
  * When working in algebraic categories other than commutative rings -- for example fields, abelian
    groups, modules -- it is sometimes useful to use normalization tactics adapted to those categories
    (`field_simp`, `abel`, `module`).
  * To skip normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization tactic.
  * The `linear_combination` tactic creates a linear combination by adding the provided (in)equalities
    together from left to right, so if `tac` is not invariant under commutation of additive
    expressions, then the order of the input hypotheses can matter.

  The variant `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th power before
  subtracting the combination `e`. In other words, if the goal is `t1 = t2`,
  `linear_combination (exp := n) e` will change the goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as
  above.  This variant is implemented only for linear combinations of equalities (i.e., not for
  inequalities).

syntax "linear_combination'"... [Mathlib.Tactic.LinearCombination'.linearCombination']
  `linear_combination'` attempts to simplify the target by creating a linear combination
    of a list of equalities and subtracting it from the target.
    The tactic will create a linear
    combination by adding the equalities together from left to right, so the order
    of the input hypotheses does matter.  If the `norm` field of the
    tactic is set to `skip`, then the tactic will simply set the user up to
    prove their target using the linear combination instead of normalizing the subtraction.

  Note: There is also a similar tactic `linear_combination` (no prime); this version is
  provided for backward compatibility.  Compared to this tactic, `linear_combination`:
  * drops the `←` syntax for reversing an equation, instead offering this operation using the `-`
    syntax
  * does not support multiplication of two hypotheses (`h1 * h2`), division by a hypothesis (`3 / h`),
    or inversion of a hypothesis (`h⁻¹`)
  * produces noisy output when the user adds or subtracts a constant to a hypothesis (`h + 3`)

  Note: The left and right sides of all the equalities should have the same
    type, and the coefficients should also have this type.  There must be
    instances of `Mul` and `AddGroup` for this type.

  * The input `e` in `linear_combination' e` is a linear combination of proofs of equalities,
    given as a sum/difference of coefficients multiplied by expressions.
    The coefficients may be arbitrary expressions.
    The expressions can be arbitrary proof terms proving equalities.
    Most commonly they are hypothesis names `h1, h2, ...`.
  * `linear_combination' (norm := tac) e` runs the "normalization tactic" `tac`
    on the subgoal(s) after constructing the linear combination.
    * The default normalization tactic is `ring1`, which closes the goal or fails.
    * To get a subgoal in the case that it is not immediately provable, use
      `ring_nf` as the normalization tactic.
    * To avoid normalization entirely, use `skip` as the normalization tactic.
  * `linear_combination' (exp := n) e` will take the goal to the `n`th power before subtracting the
    combination `e`. In other words, if the goal is `t1 = t2`, `linear_combination' (exp := n) e`
    will change the goal to `(t1 - t2)^n = 0` before proceeding as above.
    This feature is not supported for `linear_combination2`.
  * `linear_combination2 e` is the same as `linear_combination' e` but it produces two
    subgoals instead of one: rather than proving that `(a - b) - (a' - b') = 0` where
    `a' = b'` is the linear combination from `e` and `a = b` is the goal,
    it instead attempts to prove `a = a'` and `b = b'`.
    Because it does not use subtraction, this form is applicable also to semirings.
    * Note that a goal which is provable by `linear_combination' e` may not be provable
      by `linear_combination2 e`; in general you may need to add a coefficient to `e`
      to make both sides match, as in `linear_combination2 e + c`.
    * You can also reverse equalities using `← h`, so for example if `h₁ : a = b`
      then `2 * (← h)` is a proof of `2 * b = 2 * a`.

syntax "match"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.match]
  `match` performs case analysis on one or more expressions.
  See [Induction and Recursion][tpil4].
  The syntax for the `match` tactic is the same as term-mode `match`, except that
  the match arms are tactics instead of expressions.
  ```
  example (n : Nat) : n = n := by
    match n with
    | 0 => rfl
    | i+1 => simp
  ```

syntax "match"... [Batteries.Tactic.«tacticMatch_,,With.»]
  The syntax `match ⋯ with.` has been deprecated in favor of `nomatch ⋯`.

  Both now support multiple discriminants.

syntax "match_scalars"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Module.tacticMatch_scalars]
  Given a goal which is an equality in a type `M` (with `M` an `AddCommMonoid`), parse the LHS and
  RHS of the goal as linear combinations of `M`-atoms over some semiring `R`, and reduce the goal to
  the respective equalities of the `R`-coefficients of each atom.

  For example, this produces the goal `⊢ a * 1 + b * 1 = (b + a) * 1`:
  ```
  example [AddCommMonoid M] [Semiring R] [Module R M] (a b : R) (x : M) :
      a • x + b • x = (b + a) • x := by
    match_scalars
  ```
  This produces the two goals `⊢ a * (a * 1) + b * (b * 1) = 1` (from the `x` atom) and
  `⊢ a * -(b * 1) + b * (a * 1) = 0` (from the `y` atom):
  ```
  example [AddCommGroup M] [Ring R] [Module R M] (a b : R) (x : M) :
      a • (a • x - b • y) + (b • a • y + b • b • x) = x := by
    match_scalars
  ```
  This produces the goal `⊢ -2 * (a * 1) = a * (-2 * 1)`:
  ```
  example [AddCommGroup M] [Ring R] [Module R M] (a : R) (x : M) :
      -(2:R) • a • x = a • (-2:ℤ) • x  := by
    match_scalars
  ```
  The scalar type for the goals produced by the `match_scalars` tactic is the largest scalar type
  encountered; for example, if `ℕ`, `ℚ` and a characteristic-zero field `K` all occur as scalars, then
  the goals produced are equalities in `K`.  A variant of `push_cast` is used internally in
  `match_scalars` to interpret scalars from the other types in this largest type.

  If the set of scalar types encountered is not totally ordered (in the sense that for all rings `R`,
  `S` encountered, it holds that either `Algebra R S` or `Algebra S R`), then the `match_scalars`
  tactic fails.

syntax "match_target"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticMatch_target_]

syntax "mcases"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mcases]
  Like `rcases`, but operating on stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goals.
  Example: Given a goal `h : (P ∧ (Q ∨ R) ∧ (Q → R)) ⊢ₛ R`,
  `mcases h with ⟨-, ⟨hq | hr⟩, hqr⟩` will yield two goals:
  `(hq : Q, hqr : Q → R) ⊢ₛ R` and `(hr : R) ⊢ₛ R`.

  That is, `mcases h with pat` has the following semantics, based on `pat`:
  * `pat=□h'` renames `h` to `h'` in the stateful context, regardless of whether `h` is pure
  * `pat=⌜h'⌝` introduces `h' : φ`  to the pure local context if `h : ⌜φ⌝`
    (c.f. `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.ProofMode.IsPure`)
  * `pat=h'` is like `pat=⌜h'⌝` if `h` is pure
    (c.f. `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.ProofMode.IsPure`), otherwise it is like `pat=□h'`.
  * `pat=_` renames `h` to an inaccessible name
  * `pat=-` discards `h`
  * `⟨pat₁, pat₂⟩` matches on conjunctions and existential quantifiers and recurses via
    `pat₁` and `pat₂`.

    alternative via `pat₂`.

syntax "mdup"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mdup]

  The tactic `measurability` solves goals of the form `Measurable f`, `AEMeasurable f`,
  `StronglyMeasurable f`, `AEStronglyMeasurable f μ`, or `MeasurableSet s` by applying lemmas tagged
  with the `measurability` user attribute.

  Note that `measurability` uses `fun_prop` for solving measurability of functions, so statements
  about `Measurable`, `AEMeasurable`, `StronglyMeasurable` and `AEStronglyMeasurable` should be tagged
  with `fun_prop` rather that `measurability`. The `measurability` attribute is equivalent to
  `fun_prop` in these cases for backward compatibility with the earlier implementation.

syntax "measurability!"... [measurability!]
  The tactic `measurability` solves goals of the form `Measurable f`, `AEMeasurable f`,

  in one another.

syntax "mframe"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mframeMacro]
  `mframe` infers which hypotheses from the stateful context can be moved into the pure context.
  This is useful because pure hypotheses "survive" the next application of modus ponens
  (`Std.Do.SPred.mp`) and transitivity (`Std.Do.SPred.entails.trans`).

  It is used as part of the `mspec` tactic.

  ```lean

  ```

syntax "mintro"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mintro]
  Like `intro`, but introducing stateful hypotheses into the stateful context of the `Std.Do.SPred`
  proof mode.
  That is, given a stateful goal `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)* ⊢ₛ P → T`, `mintro h` transforms
  into `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)*, (h : P) ⊢ₛ T`.

  Furthermore, `mintro ∀s` is like `intro s`, but preserves the stateful goal.
  That is, `mintro ∀s` brings the topmost state variable `s:σ` in scope and transforms
  `(hᵢ : Hᵢ)* ⊢ₛ T` (where the entailment is in `Std.Do.SPred (σ::σs)`) into
  `(hᵢ : Hᵢ s)* ⊢ₛ T s` (where the entailment is in `Std.Do.SPred σs`).

  Beyond that, `mintro` supports the full syntax of `mcases` patterns
  (`mintro pat = (mintro h; mcases h with pat`), and can perform multiple
  introductions in sequence.

  Leaves the stateful proof mode of `Std.Do.SPred`, tries to eta-expand through all definitions

  proposition. This is often the right thing to do after `mvcgen` in order for automation to prove
  the goal.

syntax "mod_cases"... [Mathlib.Tactic.ModCases.«tacticMod_cases_:_%_»]
  * The tactic `mod_cases h : e % 3` will perform a case disjunction on `e`.
    If `e : ℤ`, then it will yield subgoals containing the assumptions
    `h : e ≡ 0 [ZMOD 3]`, `h : e ≡ 1 [ZMOD 3]`, `h : e ≡ 2 [ZMOD 3]`
    respectively. If `e : ℕ` instead, then it works similarly, except with
    `[MOD 3]` instead of `[ZMOD 3]`.
  * In general, `mod_cases h : e % n` works
    when `n` is a positive numeral and `e` is an expression of type `ℕ` or `ℤ`.
  * If `h` is omitted as in `mod_cases e % n`, it will be default-named `H`.

syntax "module"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Module.tacticModule]
  Given a goal which is an equality in a type `M` (with `M` an `AddCommMonoid`), parse the LHS and
  RHS of the goal as linear combinations of `M`-atoms over some commutative semiring `R`, and prove
  the goal by checking that the LHS- and RHS-coefficients of each atom are the same up to
  ring-normalization in `R`.

  (If the proofs of coefficient-wise equality will require more reasoning than just
  ring-normalization, use the tactic `match_scalars` instead, and then prove coefficient-wise equality
  by hand.)

  Example uses of the `module` tactic:
  ```
  example [AddCommMonoid M] [CommSemiring R] [Module R M] (a b : R) (x : M) :
      a • x + b • x = (b + a) • x := by
    module

      (2:K)⁻¹ • x + (3:K)⁻¹ • x + (6:K)⁻¹ • x = x := by
    module

  example [AddCommGroup M] [CommRing R] [Module R M] (a : R) (v w : M) :
      (1 + a ^ 2) • (v + w) - a • (a • v - w) = v + (1 + a + a ^ 2) • w := by
    module

  example [AddCommGroup M] [CommRing R] [Module R M] (a b μ ν : R) (x y : M) :

    module
  ```

syntax "monicity"... [Mathlib.Tactic.ComputeDegree.monicityMacro]
  `monicity` tries to solve a goal of the form `Monic f`.
  It converts the goal into a goal of the form `natDegree f ≤ n` and one of the form `f.coeff n = 1`
  and calls `compute_degree` on those two goals.

  The variant `monicity!` starts like `monicity`, but calls `compute_degree!` on the two side-goals.

      (h' : z ≤ y) :

    mono
  ```

syntax "monoidal"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Monoidal.tacticMonoidal]
  Use the coherence theorem for monoidal categories to solve equations in a monoidal category,
  where the two sides only differ by replacing strings of monoidal structural morphisms
  (that is, associators, unitors, and identities)
  with different strings of structural morphisms with the same source and target.

  That is, `monoidal` can handle goals of the form
  `a ≫ f ≫ b ≫ g ≫ c = a' ≫ f ≫ b' ≫ g ≫ c'`
  where `a = a'`, `b = b'`, and `c = c'` can be proved using `monoidal_coherence`.

syntax "move_add"... [Mathlib.MoveAdd.tacticMove_add_]
  The tactic `move_add` rearranges summands of expressions.
  Calling `move_add [a, ← b, ...]` matches `a, b,...` with summands in the main goal.
  It then moves `a` to the far right and `b` to the far left of each addition in which they appear.
  The side to which the summands are moved is determined by the presence or absence of the arrow `←`.

  The inputs `a, b,...` can be any terms, also with underscores.
  The tactic uses the first "new" summand that unifies with each one of the given inputs.

  There is a multiplicative variant, called `move_mul`.

  There is also a general tactic for a "binary associative commutative operation": `move_oper`.
  In this case the syntax requires providing first a term whose head symbol is the operation.
  E.g. `move_oper HAdd.hAdd [...]` is the same as `move_add`, while `move_oper Max.max [...]`
  rearranges `max`s.

  `mpure_intro` operates on a stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goal of the form `P ⊢ₛ ⌜φ⌝`.

  example (P Q : SPred σs) : P ⊢ₛ Q ∨ P := by
    mintro HP
    mright
    mexact HP

  `mright` is like `right`, but operating on a stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goal.
  ```lean
  example (P Q : SPred σs) : P ⊢ₛ Q ∨ P := by
    mintro HP
    mright
    mexact HP
  ```

syntax "mspec"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mspec]
  `mspec` is an `apply`-like tactic that applies a Hoare triple specification to the target of the
  stateful goal.

  Given a stateful goal `H ⊢ₛ wp⟦prog⟧ Q'`, `mspec foo_spec` will instantiate
  `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, match `foo` against `prog` and produce subgoals for
  the verification conditions `?pre : H ⊢ₛ P` and `?post : Q ⊢ₚ Q'`.

  * If `prog = x >>= f`, then `mspec Specs.bind` is tried first so that `foo` is matched against `x`
    instead. Tactic `mspec_no_bind` does not attempt to do this decomposition.
  * If `?pre` or `?post` follow by `.rfl`, then they are discharged automatically.
  * `?post` is automatically simplified into constituent `⊢ₛ` entailments on
    success and failure continuations.
  * `?pre` and `?post.*` goals introduce their stateful hypothesis under an inaccessible name.
    You can give it a name with the `mrename_i` tactic.
  * Any uninstantiated MVar arising from instantiation of `foo_spec` becomes a new subgoal.
  * If the target of the stateful goal looks like `fun s => _` then `mspec` will first `mintro ∀s`.
  * If `P` has schematic variables that can be instantiated by doing `mintro ∀s`, for example
    `foo_spec : ∀(n:Nat), ⦃fun s => ⌜n = s⌝⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, then `mspec` will do `mintro ∀s` first to
    instantiate `n = s`.
  * Right before applying the spec, the `mframe` tactic is used, which has the following effect:
    Any hypothesis `Hᵢ` in the goal `h₁:H₁, h₂:H₂, ..., hₙ:Hₙ ⊢ₛ T` that is
    pure (i.e., equivalent to some `⌜φᵢ⌝`) will be moved into the pure context as `hᵢ:φᵢ`.

  Additionally, `mspec` can be used without arguments or with a term argument:

  * `mspec` without argument will try and look up a spec for `x` registered with `@[spec]`.
  * `mspec (foo_spec blah ?bleh)` will elaborate its argument as a term with expected type
    `⦃?P⦄ x ⦃?Q⦄` and introduce `?bleh` as a subgoal.
    This is useful to pass an invariant to e.g., `Specs.forIn_list` and leave the inductive step
    as a hole.

syntax "mspec"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mspecMacro]
  `mspec` is an `apply`-like tactic that applies a Hoare triple specification to the target of the
  stateful goal.

  `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ⦃Q⦄`, match `foo` against `prog` and produce subgoals for

  * If `prog = x >>= f`, then `mspec Specs.bind` is tried first so that `foo` is matched against `x`
    instead. Tactic `mspec_no_bind` does not attempt to do this decomposition.
  * If `?pre` or `?post` follow by `.rfl`, then they are discharged automatically.
  * `?post` is automatically simplified into constituent `⊢ₛ` entailments on
    success and failure continuations.
  * `?pre` and `?post.*` goals introduce their stateful hypothesis under an inaccessible name.

syntax "mspec_no_bind"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mspecNoBind]
  `mspec_no_simp $spec` first tries to decompose `Bind.bind`s before applying `$spec`.
  This variant of `mspec_no_simp` does not; `mspec_no_bind $spec` is defined as
  ```
  try with_reducible mspec_no_bind Std.Do.Spec.bind
  mspec_no_bind $spec
  ```

syntax "mspec_no_simp"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mspecNoSimp]
  Like `mspec`, but does not attempt slight simplification and closing of trivial sub-goals.
  `mspec $spec` is roughly (the set of simp lemmas below might not be up to date)
  ```
  mspec_no_simp $spec
  all_goals
    ((try simp only [SPred.true_intro_simp, SPred.apply_pure]);
     (try mpure_intro; trivial))
  ```

syntax "mspecialize"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mspecializeMacro]
  `mspecialize` is like `specialize`, but operating on a stateful `Std.Do.SPred` goal.
  It specializes a hypothesis from the stateful context with hypotheses from either the pure
  or stateful context or pure terms.
  ```lean
  example (P Q : SPred σs) : P ⊢ₛ (P → Q) → Q := by

  It specializes a hypothesis from the stateful context with hypotheses from either the pure
  or stateful context or pure terms.
  ```lean
  example (P Q : SPred σs) : P ⊢ₛ (P → Q) → Q := by
    mintro HP HPQ
    mspecialize HPQ HP
    mexact HPQ

  example (y : Nat) (P Q : SPred σs) (Ψ : Nat → SPred σs) (hP : ⊢ₛ P) : ⊢ₛ Q → (∀ x, P → Q → Ψ x) → Ψ (y + 1) := by
    mintro HQ HΨ
    mspecialize HΨ (y + 1) hP HQ
    mexact HΨ
  ```

syntax "mspecialize_pure"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mspecializePure]
  `mspecialize_pure` is like `mspecialize`, but it specializes a hypothesis from the
  *pure* context with hypotheses from either the pure or stateful context or pure terms.
  ```lean
  example (y : Nat) (P Q : SPred σs) (Ψ : Nat → SPred σs) (hP : ⊢ₛ P) (hΨ : ∀ x, ⊢ₛ P → Q → Ψ x) : ⊢ₛ Q → Ψ (y + 1) := by

    mexact HΨ
  ```

syntax "mstart"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mstartMacro]
  Start the stateful proof mode of `Std.Do.SPred`.
  This will transform a stateful goal of the form `H ⊢ₛ T` into `⊢ₛ H → T`
  upon which `mintro` can be used to re-introduce `H` and give it a name.
  It is often more convenient to use `mintro` directly, which will
  try `mstart` automatically if necessary.

syntax "mstart"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mstart]

  upon which `mintro` can be used to re-introduce `H` and give it a name.

syntax "mv_bisim"... [Mathlib.Tactic.MvBisim.tacticMv_bisim___With___]
  tactic for proof by bisimulation

syntax "mvcgen"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mvcgenMacro]
  `mvcgen` will break down a Hoare triple proof goal like `⦃P⦄ prog ⦃Q⦄` into verification conditions,
  provided that all functions used in `prog` have specifications registered with `@[spec]`.

  ### Verification Conditions and specifications

  A verification condition is an entailment in the stateful logic of `Std.Do.SPred`
  in which the original program `prog` no longer occurs.
  Verification conditions are introduced by the `mspec` tactic; see the `mspec` tactic for what they
  look like.
  When there's no applicable `mspec` spec, `mvcgen` will try and rewrite an application
  `prog = f a b c` with the simp set registered via `@[spec]`.

  ### Features

  When used like `mvcgen +noLetElim [foo_spec, bar_def, instBEqFloat]`, `mvcgen` will additionally

  * add a Hoare triple specification `foo_spec : ... → ⦃P⦄ foo ... ⦃Q⦄` to `spec` set for a
    function `foo` occurring in `prog`,
  * unfold a definition `def bar_def ... := ...` in `prog`,
  * unfold any method of the `instBEqFloat : BEq Float` instance in `prog`.
  * it will no longer substitute away `let`-expressions that occur at most once in `P`, `Q` or `prog`.

  ### Config options

  `+noLetElim` is just one config option of many. Check out `Lean.Elab.Tactic.Do.VCGen.Config` for all
  options. Of particular note is `stepLimit = some 42`, which is useful for bisecting bugs in
  `mvcgen` and tracing its execution.

  ### Extended syntax

  Often, `mvcgen` will be used like this:
  ```
  mvcgen [...]
  case inv1 => by exact I1
  case inv2 => by exact I2
  all_goals (mleave; try grind)
  ```
  There is special syntax for this:
  ```
  mvcgen [...] invariants
  · I1
  · I2
  with grind
  ```
  When `I1` and `I2` need to refer to inaccessibles (`mvcgen` will introduce a lot of them for program
  variables), you can use case label syntax:
  ```
  mvcgen [...] invariants
  | inv1 _ acc _ => I1 acc
  | _ => I2
  with grind
  ```
  This is more convenient than the equivalent `· by rename_i _ acc _; exact I1 acc`.

  ### Invariant suggestions

  `mvcgen` will suggest invariants for you if you use the `invariants?` keyword.
  ```
  mvcgen [...] invariants?
  ```
  This is useful if you do not recall the exact syntax to construct invariants.
  Furthermore, it will suggest a concrete invariant encoding "this holds at the start of the loop and
  this must hold at the end of the loop" by looking at the corresponding VCs.
  Although the suggested invariant is a good starting point, it is too strong and requires users to
  interpolate it such that the inductive step can be proved. Example:
  ```
  def mySum (l : List Nat) : Nat := Id.run do
    let mut acc := 0
    for x in l do
      acc := acc + x
    return acc
```

syntax "mvcgen?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.mvcgenHint]
  A hint tactic that expands to `mvcgen invariants?`.

syntax "mvcgen_trivial"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticMvcgen_trivial]
  `mvcgen_trivial` is the tactic automatically called by `mvcgen` to discharge VCs.
  It tries to discharge the VC by applying `(try mpure_intro); trivial` and otherwise delegates to
  `mvcgen_trivial_extensible`.
  Users are encouraged to extend `mvcgen_trivial_extensible` instead of this tactic in order not to
  override the default `(try mpure_intro); trivial` behavior.

syntax "mvcgen_trivial_extensible"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticMvcgen_trivial_extensible]

syntax "native_decide"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.nativeDecide]
  `native_decide` is a synonym for `decide +native`.
  It will attempt to prove a goal of type `p` by synthesizing an instance
  of `Decidable p` and then evaluating it to `isTrue ..`. Unlike `decide`, this
  uses `#eval` to evaluate the decidability instance.

  This should be used with care because it adds the entire lean compiler to the trusted
  part, and the axiom `Lean.ofReduceBool` will show up in `#print axioms` for theorems using
  this method or anything that transitively depends on them. Nevertheless, because it is
  compiled, this can be significantly more efficient than using `decide`, and for very
  large computations this is one way to run external programs and trust the result.
  ```lean
  example : (List.range 1000).length = 1000 := by native_decide
  ```

syntax "next"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.«tacticNext_=>_»]
  `next => tac` focuses on the next goal and solves it using `tac`, or else fails.
  `next x₁ ... xₙ => tac` additionally renames the `n` most recent hypotheses with
  inaccessible names to the given names.

syntax "nlinarith"... [Mathlib.Tactic.nlinarith]
  An extension of `linarith` with some preprocessing to allow it to solve some nonlinear arithmetic
  problems. (Based on Coq's `nra` tactic.) See `linarith` for the available syntax of options,
  which are inherited by `nlinarith`; that is, `nlinarith!` and `nlinarith only [h1, h2]` all work as
  in `linarith`. The preprocessing is as follows:

  * For every subterm `a ^ 2` or `a * a` in a hypothesis or the goal,
    the assumption `0 ≤ a ^ 2` or `0 ≤ a * a` is added to the context.
  * For every pair of hypotheses `a1 R1 b1`, `a2 R2 b2` in the context, `R1, R2 ∈ {<, ≤, =}`,
    the assumption `0 R' (b1 - a1) * (b2 - a2)` is added to the context (non-recursively),
    where `R ∈ {<, ≤, =}` is the appropriate comparison derived from `R1, R2`.

syntax "nlinarith!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticNlinarith!_]
  An extension of `linarith` with some preprocessing to allow it to solve some nonlinear arithmetic
  problems. (Based on Coq's `nra` tactic.) See `linarith` for the available syntax of options,
  which are inherited by `nlinarith`; that is, `nlinarith!` and `nlinarith only [h1, h2]` all work as
  in `linarith`. The preprocessing is as follows:

  * For every subterm `a ^ 2` or `a * a` in a hypothesis or the goal,
    the assumption `0 ≤ a ^ 2` or `0 ≤ a * a` is added to the context.
  * For every pair of hypotheses `a1 R1 b1`, `a2 R2 b2` in the context, `R1, R2 ∈ {<, ≤, =}`,
    the assumption `0 R' (b1 - a1) * (b2 - a2)` is added to the context (non-recursively),
    where `R ∈ {<, ≤, =}` is the appropriate comparison derived from `R1, R2`.

syntax "nofun"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticNofun]
  The tactic `nofun` is shorthand for `exact nofun`: it introduces the assumptions, then performs an
  empty pattern match, closing the goal if the introduced pattern is impossible.

syntax "nomatch"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.«tacticNomatch_,,»]
  The tactic `nomatch h` is shorthand for `exact nomatch h`.

syntax "noncomm_ring"... [Mathlib.Tactic.NoncommRing.noncomm_ring]
  A tactic for simplifying identities in not-necessarily-commutative rings.

  An example:
  ```lean
  example {R : Type*} [Ring R] (a b c : R) : a * (b + c + c - b) = 2 * a * c := by
    noncomm_ring
  ```

  You can use `noncomm_ring [h]` to also simplify using `h`.

syntax "nontriviality"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Nontriviality.nontriviality]
  Attempts to generate a `Nontrivial α` hypothesis.

  The tactic first checks to see that there is not already a `Nontrivial α` instance
  before trying to synthesize one using other techniques.

  If the goal is an (in)equality, the type `α` is inferred from the goal.
  Otherwise, the type needs to be specified in the tactic invocation, as `nontriviality α`.

  The `nontriviality` tactic will first look for strict inequalities amongst the hypotheses,
  and use these to derive the `Nontrivial` instance directly.

  Otherwise, it will perform a case split on `Subsingleton α ∨ Nontrivial α`, and attempt to discharge
  the `Subsingleton` goal using `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ, nontriviality]`, where `[h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is
  a list of additional `simp` lemmas that can be passed to `nontriviality` using the syntax
  `nontriviality α using h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ`.

  ```
  example {R : Type} [OrderedRing R] {a : R} (h : 0 < a) : 0 < a := by
    nontriviality -- There is now a `Nontrivial R` hypothesis available.
    assumption
  ```

  ```
  example {R : Type} [CommRing R] {r s : R} : r * s = s * r := by
    nontriviality -- There is now a `Nontrivial R` hypothesis available.
    apply mul_comm
  ```

  ```

    nontriviality R -- there is now a `Nontrivial R` hypothesis available.

  ```

    success_if_fail nontriviality α -- Fails
    nontriviality α using myeq -- There is now a `Nontrivial α` hypothesis available
    assumption
  ```

syntax "norm_cast"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticNorm_cast__]
  The `norm_cast` family of tactics is used to normalize certain coercions (*casts*) in expressions.
  - `norm_cast` normalizes casts in the target.
  - `norm_cast at h` normalizes casts in hypothesis `h`.

  The tactic is basically a version of `simp` with a specific set of lemmas to move casts
  upwards in the expression.
  Therefore even in situations where non-terminal `simp` calls are discouraged (because of fragility),
  `norm_cast` is considered to be safe.
  It also has special handling of numerals.

  For instance, given an assumption
  ```lean
  a b : ℤ
  h : ↑a + ↑b < (10 : ℚ)
  ```
  writing `norm_cast at h` will turn `h` into
  ```lean
  h : a + b < 10
  ```

  There are also variants of basic tactics that use `norm_cast` to normalize expressions during
  their operation, to make them more flexible about the expressions they accept
  (we say that it is a tactic *modulo* the effects of `norm_cast`):
  - `exact_mod_cast` for `exact` and `apply_mod_cast` for `apply`.
    Writing `exact_mod_cast h` and `apply_mod_cast h` will normalize casts
    in the goal and `h` before using `exact h` or `apply h`.
  - `rw_mod_cast` for `rw`. It applies `norm_cast` between rewrites.
  - `assumption_mod_cast` for `assumption`.
    This is effectively `norm_cast at *; assumption`, but more efficient.
    It normalizes casts in the goal and, for every hypothesis `h` in the context,
    it will try to normalize casts in `h` and use `exact h`.

  See also `push_cast`, which moves casts inwards rather than lifting them outwards.

syntax "norm_cast0"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.normCast0]
  Implementation of `norm_cast` (the full `norm_cast` calls `trivial` afterwards).

syntax "norm_num"... [Mathlib.Tactic.normNum]
  Normalize numerical expressions. Supports the operations `+` `-` `*` `/` `⁻¹` `^` and `%`
  over numerical types such as `ℕ`, `ℤ`, `ℚ`, `ℝ`, `ℂ` and some general algebraic types,
  and can prove goals of the form `A = B`, `A ≠ B`, `A < B` and `A ≤ B`, where `A` and `B` are
  numerical expressions. It also has a relatively simple primality prover.

syntax "norm_num1"... [Mathlib.Tactic.normNum1]
  Basic version of `norm_num` that does not call `simp`.

syntax "nth_grewrite"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticNth_grewrite_____]
  `nth_grewrite` is just like `nth_rewrite`, but for `grewrite`.

syntax "nth_grw"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticNth_grw_____]
  `nth_grw` is just like `nth_rw`, but for `grw`.

syntax "nth_rewrite"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticNth_rewrite_____]
  `nth_rewrite` is a variant of `rewrite` that only changes the `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ _occurrence_ of
  the expression to be rewritten. `nth_rewrite n₁ ... nₖ [eq₁, eq₂,..., eqₘ]` will rewrite the
  `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ _occurrence_ of each of the `m` equalities `eqᵢ`in that order. Occurrences are
  counted beginning with `1` in order of precedence.

  For example,
  ```lean
  example (h : a = 1) : a + a + a + a + a = 5 := by
    nth_rewrite 2 3 [h]
```

  a: ℕ
  h: a = 1
  ⊢ a + 1 + 1 + a + a = 5
  
```lean
```
  Notice that the second and third occurrences of `a` from the left have been rewritten by
  `nth_rewrite`.

  To understand the importance of order of precedence, consider the example below
  ```lean
  example (a b c : Nat) : (a + b) + c = (b + a) + c := by
    nth_rewrite 2 [Nat.add_comm] -- ⊢ (b + a) + c = (b + a) + c
  ```
  Here, although the occurrence parameter is `2`, `(a + b)` is rewritten to `(b + a)`. This happens
  because in order of precedence, the first occurrence of `_ + _` is the one that adds `a + b` to `c`.
  The occurrence in `a + b` counts as the second occurrence.

  If a term `t` is introduced by rewriting with `eqᵢ`, then this instance of `t` will be counted as an
  _occurrence_ of `t` for all subsequent rewrites of `t` with `eqⱼ` for `j > i`. This behaviour is
  illustrated by the example below
  ```lean
  example (h : a = a + b) : a + a + a + a + a = 0 := by
    nth_rewrite 3 [h, h]
```

  a b: ℕ
  h: a = a + b
  ⊢ a + a + (a + b + b) + a + a = 0
  
```lean
```
  Here, the first `nth_rewrite` with `h` introduces an additional occurrence of `a` in the goal.
  That is, the goal state after the first rewrite looks like below
  ```lean
```

  a b: ℕ
  h: a = a + b
  ⊢ a + a + (a + b) + a + a = 0
  
```lean
```
  This new instance of `a` also turns out to be the third _occurrence_ of `a`.  Therefore,
  the next `nth_rewrite` with `h` rewrites this `a`.

syntax "nth_rw"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticNth_rw_____]
  `nth_rw` is a variant of `rw` that only changes the `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ _occurrence_ of the expression
  to be rewritten. Like `rw`, and unlike `nth_rewrite`, it will try to close the goal by trying `rfl`
  afterwards. `nth_rw n₁ ... nₖ [eq₁, eq₂,..., eqₘ]` will rewrite the `n₁, ..., nₖ`ᵗʰ _occurrence_ of
  each of the `m` equalities `eqᵢ`in that order. Occurrences are counted beginning with `1` in
  order of precedence. For example,
  ```lean
  example (h : a = 1) : a + a + a + a + a = 5 := by
    nth_rw 2 3 [h]
```

  a: ℕ
  h: a = 1
  ⊢ a + 1 + 1 + a + a = 5
  
```lean
```
  Notice that the second and third occurrences of `a` from the left have been rewritten by
  `nth_rw`.

  To understand the importance of order of precedence, consider the example below
  ```lean
  example (a b c : Nat) : (a + b) + c = (b + a) + c := by
    nth_rewrite 2 [Nat.add_comm] -- ⊢ (b + a) + c = (b + a) + c
  ```
  Here, although the occurrence parameter is `2`, `(a + b)` is rewritten to `(b + a)`. This happens
  because in order of precedence, the first occurrence of `_ + _` is the one that adds `a + b` to `c`.
  The occurrence in `a + b` counts as the second occurrence.

  If a term `t` is introduced by rewriting with `eqᵢ`, then this instance of `t` will be counted as an
  _occurrence_ of `t` for all subsequent rewrites of `t` with `eqⱼ` for `j > i`. This behaviour is
  illustrated by the example below
  ```lean
  example (h : a = a + b) : a + a + a + a + a = 0 := by
    nth_rw 3 [h, h]
```

  a b: ℕ
  h: a = a + b
  ⊢ a + a + (a + b + b) + a + a = 0
  
```lean
```
  Here, the first `nth_rw` with `h` introduces an additional occurrence of `a` in the goal. That is,
  the goal state after the first rewrite looks like below
  ```lean
```

  a b: ℕ
  h: a = a + b
  ⊢ a + a + (a + b) + a + a = 0
  
```lean
```
  This new instance of `a` also turns out to be the third _occurrence_ of `a`.  Therefore,
  the next `nth_rw` with `h` rewrites this `a`.

  Further, `nth_rw` will close the remaining goal with `rfl` if possible.

syntax "observe"... [Mathlib.Tactic.LibrarySearch.observe]
  `observe hp : p` asserts the proposition `p`, and tries to prove it using `exact?`.
  If no proof is found, the tactic fails.
  In other words, this tactic is equivalent to `have hp : p := by exact?`.

  If `hp` is omitted, then the placeholder `this` is used.

  The variant `observe? hp : p` will emit a trace message of the form `have hp : p := proof_term`.
  This may be particularly useful to speed up proofs.

syntax "observe?"... [Mathlib.Tactic.LibrarySearch.«tacticObserve?__:_Using__,,»]
  `observe hp : p` asserts the proposition `p`, and tries to prove it using `exact?`.
  If no proof is found, the tactic fails.
  In other words, this tactic is equivalent to `have hp : p := by exact?`.

  If `hp` is omitted, then the placeholder `this` is used.

  The variant `observe? hp : p` will emit a trace message of the form `have hp : p := proof_term`.
  This may be particularly useful to speed up proofs.

syntax "observe?"... [Mathlib.Tactic.LibrarySearch.«tacticObserve?__:_»]
  `observe hp : p` asserts the proposition `p`, and tries to prove it using `exact?`.
  If no proof is found, the tactic fails.
  In other words, this tactic is equivalent to `have hp : p := by exact?`.

  If `hp` is omitted, then the placeholder `this` is used.

  The variant `observe? hp : p` will emit a trace message of the form `have hp : p := proof_term`.
  This may be particularly useful to speed up proofs.

syntax "obtain"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.obtain]
  The `obtain` tactic is a combination of `have` and `rcases`. See `rcases` for
  a description of supported patterns.

  ```lean
  obtain ⟨patt⟩ : type := proof
  ```
  is equivalent to
  ```lean
  have h : type := proof
  rcases h with ⟨patt⟩
  ```

  If `⟨patt⟩` is omitted, `rcases` will try to infer the pattern.

  If `type` is omitted, `:= proof` is required.

syntax "omega"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.omega]
  The `omega` tactic, for resolving integer and natural linear arithmetic problems.

  It is not yet a full decision procedure (no "dark" or "grey" shadows),
  but should be effective on many problems.

  We handle hypotheses of the form `x = y`, `x < y`, `x ≤ y`, and `k ∣ x` for `x y` in `Nat` or `Int`
  (and `k` a literal), along with negations of these statements.

  We decompose the sides of the inequalities as linear combinations of atoms.

  If we encounter `x / k` or `x % k` for literal integers `k` we introduce new auxiliary variables
  and the relevant inequalities.

  On the first pass, we do not perform case splits on natural subtraction.
  If `omega` fails, we recursively perform a case split on
  a natural subtraction appearing in a hypothesis, and try again.

  The options
  ```
  omega +splitDisjunctions +splitNatSub +splitNatAbs +splitMinMax
  ```
  can be used to:
  * `splitDisjunctions`: split any disjunctions found in the context,
    if the problem is not otherwise solvable.
  * `splitNatSub`: for each appearance of `((a - b : Nat) : Int)`, split on `a ≤ b` if necessary.
  * `splitNatAbs`: for each appearance of `Int.natAbs a`, split on `0 ≤ a` if necessary.
  * `splitMinMax`: for each occurrence of `min a b`, split on `min a b = a ∨ min a b = b`
  Currently, all of these are on by default.

syntax "on_goal"... [Batteries.Tactic.«tacticOn_goal-_=>_»]
  `on_goal n => tacSeq` creates a block scope for the `n`-th goal and tries the sequence
  of tactics `tacSeq` on it.

  `on_goal -n => tacSeq` does the same, but the `n`-th goal is chosen by counting from the
  bottom.

  The goal is not required to be solved and any resulting subgoals are inserted back into the
  list of goals, replacing the chosen goal.

syntax "open"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.open]
  `open Foo in tacs` (the tactic) acts like `open Foo` at command level,
  but it opens a namespace only within the tactics `tacs`.

syntax "order"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Order.tacticOrder_]
  A finishing tactic for solving goals in arbitrary `Preorder`, `PartialOrder`,
  or `LinearOrder`. Supports `⊤`, `⊥`, and lattice operations.

syntax "order_core"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Order.order_core]
  `order_core` is the part of the `order` tactic that tries to find a contradiction.

syntax "peel"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Peel.peel]
  Peels matching quantifiers off of a given term and the goal and introduces the relevant variables.

  - `peel e` peels all quantifiers (at reducible transparency),
    using `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
  - `peel e with h` is `peel e` but names the peeled hypothesis `h`.
    If `h` is `_` then uses `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
  - `peel n e` peels `n` quantifiers (at default transparency).
  - `peel n e with x y z ... h` peels `n` quantifiers, names the peeled hypothesis `h`,
    and uses `x`, `y`, `z`, and so on to name the introduced variables; these names may be `_`.
    If `h` is `_` then uses `this` for the name of the peeled hypothesis.
    The length of the list of variables does not need to equal `n`.
  - `peel e with x₁ ... xₙ h` is `peel n e with x₁ ... xₙ h`.

  There are also variants that apply to an iff in the goal:
  - `peel n` peels `n` quantifiers in an iff.
  - `peel with x₁ ... xₙ` peels `n` quantifiers in an iff and names them.

  Given `p q : ℕ → Prop`, `h : ∀ x, p x`, and a goal `⊢ : ∀ x, q x`, the tactic `peel h with x h'`
  will introduce `x : ℕ`, `h' : p x` into the context and the new goal will be `⊢ q x`. This works
  with `∃`, as well as `∀ᶠ` and `∃ᶠ`, and it can even be applied to a sequence of quantifiers. Note
  that this is a logically weaker setup, so using this tactic is not always feasible.

  For a more complex example, given a hypothesis and a goal:
  ```
  h : ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
  ⊢ ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ ε
  ```
  (which differ only in `<`/`≤`), applying `peel h with ε hε N n hn h_peel` will yield a tactic state:
  ```
  h : ∀ ε > (0 : ℝ), ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
  ε : ℝ
  hε : 0 < ε
  N n : ℕ
  hn : N ≤ n
  h_peel : 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) < ε
  ⊢ 1 / (n + 1 : ℝ) ≤ ε
  ```
  and the goal can be closed with `exact h_peel.le`.
  Note that in this example, `h` and the goal are logically equivalent statements, but `peel`
  *cannot* be immediately applied to show that the goal implies `h`.

  In addition, `peel` supports goals of the form `(∀ x, p x) ↔ ∀ x, q x`, or likewise for any
  other quantifier. In this case, there is no hypothesis or term to supply, but otherwise the syntax
  is the same. So for such goals, the syntax is `peel 1` or `peel with x`, and after which the
  resulting goal is `p x ↔ q x`. The `congr!` tactic can also be applied to goals of this form using
  `congr! 1 with x`. While `congr!` applies congruence lemmas in general, `peel` can be relied upon
  to only apply to outermost quantifiers.

  Finally, the user may supply a term `e` via `... using e` in order to close the goal
  immediately. In particular, `peel h using e` is equivalent to `peel h; exact e`. The `using` syntax
  may be paired with any of the other features of `peel`.

  This tactic works by repeatedly applying lemmas such as `forall_imp`, `Exists.imp`,
  `Filter.Eventually.mp`, `Filter.Frequently.mp`, and `Filter.Eventually.of_forall`.

syntax "pgame_wf_tac"... [SetTheory.PGame.tacticPgame_wf_tac]
  Discharges proof obligations of the form `⊢ Subsequent ..` arising in termination proofs
  of definitions using well-founded recursion on `PGame`.

syntax "pi_lower_bound"... [Real.«tacticPi_lower_bound[_,,]»]
  Create a proof of `a < π` for a fixed rational number `a`, given a witness, which is a
  sequence of rational numbers `√2 < r 1 < r 2 < ... < r n < 2` satisfying the property that
  `√(2 + r i) ≤ r(i+1)`, where `r 0 = 0` and `√(2 - r n) ≥ a/2^(n+1)`.

syntax "pi_upper_bound"... [Real.«tacticPi_upper_bound[_,,]»]
  Create a proof of `π < a` for a fixed rational number `a`, given a witness, which is a
  sequence of rational numbers `√2 < r 1 < r 2 < ... < r n < 2` satisfying the property that
  `√(2 + r i) ≥ r(i+1)`, where `r 0 = 0` and `√(2 - r n) ≤ (a - 1/4^n) / 2^(n+1)`.

syntax "pick_goal"... [Batteries.Tactic.«tacticPick_goal-_»]
  `pick_goal n` will move the `n`-th goal to the front.

  `pick_goal -n` will move the `n`-th goal (counting from the bottom) to the front.

  See also `Tactic.rotate_goals`, which moves goals from the front to the back and vice-versa.

syntax "plausible"... [plausibleSyntax]
  `plausible` considers a proof goal and tries to generate examples
  that would contradict the statement.

  Let's consider the following proof goal.

  ```lean
  xs : List Nat,
  h : ∃ (x : Nat) (H : x ∈ xs), x < 3
  ⊢ ∀ (y : Nat), y ∈ xs → y < 5
  ```

  The local constants will be reverted and an instance will be found for
  `Testable (∀ (xs : List Nat), (∃ x ∈ xs, x < 3) → (∀ y ∈ xs, y < 5))`.
  The `Testable` instance is supported by an instance of `Sampleable (List Nat)`,
  `Decidable (x < 3)` and `Decidable (y < 5)`.

  Examples will be created in ascending order of size (more or less)

  The first counter-examples found will be printed and will result in an error:

  ```
  ===================
  Found problems!
  xs := [1, 28]
  x := 1
  y := 28
  -------------------
  ```

  If `plausible` successfully tests 100 examples, it acts like
  admit. If it gives up or finds a counter-example, it reports an error.

  For more information on writing your own `Sampleable` and `Testable`
  instances, see `Testing.Plausible.Testable`.

  Optional arguments given with `plausible (config : { ... })`
  * `numInst` (default 100): number of examples to test properties with
  * `maxSize` (default 100): final size argument

  Options:
  * `set_option trace.plausible.decoration true`: print the proposition with quantifier annotations
  * `set_option trace.plausible.discarded true`: print the examples discarded because they do not
    satisfy assumptions
  * `set_option trace.plausible.shrink.steps true`: trace the shrinking of counter-example
  * `set_option trace.plausible.shrink.candidates true`: print the lists of candidates considered
    when shrinking each variable
  * `set_option trace.plausible.instance true`: print the instances of `testable` being used to test
    the proposition
  * `set_option trace.plausible.success true`: print the tested samples that satisfy a property

syntax "pnat_positivity"... [Mathlib.Tactic.PNatToNat.tacticPnat_positivity]
  For each `x : PNat` in the context, add the hypothesis `0 < (↑x : ℕ)`.

syntax "pnat_to_nat"... [Mathlib.Tactic.PNatToNat.tacticPnat_to_nat]
  `pnat_to_nat` shifts all `PNat`s in the context to `Nat`, rewriting propositions about them.
  A typical use case is `pnat_to_nat; omega`.

syntax "polyrith"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Polyrith.«tacticPolyrithOnly[_]»]
  The `polyrith` tactic is no longer supported in Mathlib,
  because it relied on a defunct external service.

  ---

  Attempts to prove polynomial equality goals through polynomial arithmetic
  on the hypotheses (and additional proof terms if the user specifies them).
  It proves the goal by generating an appropriate call to the tactic
  `linear_combination`. If this call succeeds, the call to `linear_combination`
  is suggested to the user.

  * `polyrith` will use all relevant hypotheses in the local context.
  * `polyrith [t1, t2, t3]` will add proof terms t1, t2, t3 to the local context.
  * `polyrith only [h1, h2, h3, t1, t2, t3]` will use only local hypotheses
    `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and proofs `t1`, `t2`, `t3`. It will ignore the rest of the local context.

  Notes:
  * This tactic only works with a working internet connection, since it calls Sage
    using the SageCell web API at <https://sagecell.sagemath.org/>.
    Many thanks to the Sage team and organization for allowing this use.
  * This tactic assumes that the user has `curl` available on path.

syntax "positivity"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Positivity.positivity]
  Tactic solving goals of the form `0 ≤ x`, `0 < x` and `x ≠ 0`.  The tactic works recursively
  according to the syntax of the expression `x`, if the atoms composing the expression all have
  numeric lower bounds which can be proved positive/nonnegative/nonzero by `norm_num`.  This tactic
  either closes the goal or fails.

  `positivity [t₁, …, tₙ]` first executes `have := t₁; …; have := tₙ` in the current goal,
  then runs `positivity`. This is useful when `positivity` needs derived premises such as `0 < y`
  for division/reciprocal, or `0 ≤ x` for real powers.

  Examples:
  ```
  example {a : ℤ} (ha : 3 < a) : 0 ≤ a ^ 3 + a := by positivity

  example {a : ℤ} (ha : 1 < a) : 0 < |(3:ℤ) + a| := by positivity

  example {b : ℤ} : 0 ≤ max (-3) (b ^ 2) := by positivity

  example {a b c d : ℝ} (hab : 0 < a * b) (hb : 0 ≤ b) (hcd : c < d) :
      0 < a ^ c + 1 / (d - c) := by
    positivity [sub_pos_of_lt hcd, pos_of_mul_pos_left hab hb]
  ```

syntax "pull"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Push.pull]
  `pull` is the inverse tactic to `push`.
  It pulls the given constant towards the head of the expression. For example
  - `pull _ ∈ _` rewrites `x ∈ y ∨ ¬ x ∈ z` into `x ∈ y ∪ zᶜ`.
  - `pull (disch := positivity) Real.log` rewrites `log a + 2 * log b` into `log (a * b ^ 2)`.
  - `pull fun _ ↦ _` rewrites `f ^ 2 + 5` into `fun x => f x ^ 2 + 5` where `f` is a function.

  A lemma is considered a `pull` lemma if its reverse direction is a `push` lemma
  that actually moves the given constant away from the head. For example
  - `not_or : ¬ (p ∨ q) ↔ ¬ p ∧ ¬ q` is a `pull` lemma, but `not_not : ¬ ¬ p ↔ p` is not.
  - `log_mul : log (x * y) = log x + log y` is a `pull` lemma, but `log_abs : log |x| = log x` is not.
  - `Pi.mul_def : f * g = fun (i : ι) => f i * g i` and `Pi.one_def : 1 = fun (x : ι) => 1` are both
    `pull` lemmas for `fun`, because every `push fun _ ↦ _` lemma is also considered a `pull` lemma.

  TODO: define a `@[pull]` attribute for tagging `pull` lemmas that are not `push` lemmas.

syntax "pure_coherence"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Coherence.pure_coherence]
  `pure_coherence` uses the coherence theorem for monoidal categories to prove the goal.
  It can prove any equality made up only of associators, unitors, and identities.
  ```lean
  example {C : Type} [Category C] [MonoidalCategory C] :
    (λ_ (𝟙_ C)).hom = (ρ_ (𝟙_ C)).hom := by
    pure_coherence
  ```

  Users will typically just use the `coherence` tactic,
  which can also cope with identities of the form
  `a ≫ f ≫ b ≫ g ≫ c = a' ≫ f ≫ b' ≫ g ≫ c'`
  where `a = a'`, `b = b'`, and `c = c'` can be proved using `pure_coherence`

syntax "push"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Push.pushStx]
  `push` pushes the given constant away from the head of the expression. For example
  - `push _ ∈ _` rewrites `x ∈ {y} ∪ zᶜ` into `x = y ∨ ¬ x ∈ z`.
  - `push (disch := positivity) Real.log` rewrites `log (a * b ^ 2)` into `log a + 2 * log b`.
  - `push ¬ _` is the same as `push_neg` or `push Not`, and it rewrites
    `¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, δ < ε` into `∃ ε > 0, ∀ δ > 0, ε ≤ δ`.

  In addition to constants, `push` can be used to push `fun` and `∀` binders:
  - `push fun _ ↦ _` rewrites `fun x => f x ^ 2 + 5` into `f ^ 2 + 5`
  - `push ∀ _, _` rewrites `∀ a, p a ∧ q a` into `(∀ a, p a) ∧ (∀ a, q a)`.

  The `push` tactic can be extended using the `@[push]` attribute.

  To instead move a constant closer to the head of the expression, use the `pull` tactic.

  To push a constant at a hypothesis, use the `push ... at h` or `push ... at *` syntax.

syntax "push_cast"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.pushCast]
  `push_cast` rewrites the goal to move certain coercions (*casts*) inward, toward the leaf nodes.
  This uses `norm_cast` lemmas in the forward direction.
  For example, `↑(a + b)` will be written to `↑a + ↑b`.
  - `push_cast` moves casts inward in the goal.
  - `push_cast at h` moves casts inward in the hypothesis `h`.
  It can be used with extra simp lemmas with, for example, `push_cast [Int.add_zero]`.

  Example:
  ```lean
  example (a b : Nat)
      (h1 : ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10)
      (h2 : ((a + b + 0 : Nat) : Int) = 10) :
      ((a + b : Nat) : Int) = 10 := by
```

    h1 : ↑(a + b) = 10
    h2 : ↑(a + b + 0) = 10
    ⊢ ↑(a + b) = 10
    
```lean
push_cast
```
 Now
    ⊢ ↑a + ↑b = 10
    
```lean
push_cast at h1
    push_cast [Int.add_zero] at h2
```
 Now
    h1 h2 : ↑a + ↑b = 10
    
```lean
exact h1
  ```

  See also `norm_cast`.

syntax "push_neg"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Push.push_neg]
  Push negations into the conclusion or a hypothesis.
  For instance, a hypothesis `h : ¬ ∀ x, ∃ y, x ≤ y` will be transformed by `push_neg at h` into
  `h : ∃ x, ∀ y, y < x`. Binder names are preserved.

  `push_neg` is a special case of the more general `push` tactic, namely `push Not`.
  The `push` tactic can be extended using the `@[push]` attribute. `push` has special-casing
  built in for `push Not`, so that it can preserve binder names, and so that `¬ (p ∧ q)` can be
  transformed to either `p → ¬ q` (default) or `¬ p ∨ ¬ q` (`push_neg +distrib`).

  Tactics that introduce a negation usually have a version that automatically calls `push_neg` on
  that negation. These include `by_cases!`, `contrapose!` and `by_contra!`.

  Another example: given a hypothesis
  ```lean
  h : ¬ ∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - y₀| ≤ ε
  ```
  writing `push_neg at h` will turn `h` into
  ```lean
  h : ∃ ε > 0, ∀ δ > 0, ∃ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ∧ ε < |f x - y₀|
  ```
  Note that binder names are preserved by this tactic, contrary to what would happen with `simp`
  using the relevant lemmas. One can use this tactic at the goal using `push_neg`,
  at every hypothesis and the goal using `push_neg at *` or at selected hypotheses and the goal
  using say `push_neg at h h' ⊢`, as usual.

syntax "qify"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Qify.qify]
  The `qify` tactic is used to shift propositions from `ℕ` or `ℤ` to `ℚ`.
  This is often useful since `ℚ` has well-behaved division.
  ```
  example (a b c x y z : ℕ) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
    qify
    qify at h
```

    h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
    ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b
    
```lean
sorry
  ```
  `qify` can be given extra lemmas to use in simplification. This is especially useful in the
  presence of nat subtraction: passing `≤` arguments will allow `push_cast` to do more work.
  ```
  example (a b c : ℤ) (h : a / b = c) (hab : b ∣ a) (hb : b ≠ 0) : a = c * b := by
    qify [hab] at h hb ⊢
    exact (div_eq_iff hb).1 h
  ```
  `qify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]` and `@[qify_simps]` attributes to move propositions,
  and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `ℚ`-valued expressions.

syntax "rcases"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rcases]
  `rcases` is a tactic that will perform `cases` recursively, according to a pattern. It is used to
  destructure hypotheses or expressions composed of inductive types like `h1 : a ∧ b ∧ c ∨ d` or
  `h2 : ∃ x y, trans_rel R x y`. Usual usage might be `rcases h1 with ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ | hd` or
  `rcases h2 with ⟨x, y, _ | ⟨z, hxz, hzy⟩⟩` for these examples.

  Each element of an `rcases` pattern is matched against a particular local hypothesis (most of which
  are generated during the execution of `rcases` and represent individual elements destructured from
  the input expression). An `rcases` pattern has the following grammar:

  * A name like `x`, which names the active hypothesis as `x`.
  * A blank `_`, which does nothing (letting the automatic naming system used by `cases` name the
    hypothesis).
  * A hyphen `-`, which clears the active hypothesis and any dependents.
  * The keyword `rfl`, which expects the hypothesis to be `h : a = b`, and calls `subst` on the
    hypothesis (which has the effect of replacing `b` with `a` everywhere or vice versa).
  * A type ascription `p : ty`, which sets the type of the hypothesis to `ty` and then matches it
    against `p`. (Of course, `ty` must unify with the actual type of `h` for this to work.)
  * A tuple pattern `⟨p1, p2, p3⟩`, which matches a constructor with many arguments, or a series
    of nested conjunctions or existentials. For example if the active hypothesis is `a ∧ b ∧ c`,
    then the conjunction will be destructured, and `p1` will be matched against `a`, `p2` against `b`
    and so on.
  * A `@` before a tuple pattern as in `@⟨p1, p2, p3⟩` will bind all arguments in the constructor,
    while leaving the `@` off will only use the patterns on the explicit arguments.
  * An alternation pattern `p1 | p2 | p3`, which matches an inductive type with multiple constructors,
    or a nested disjunction like `a ∨ b ∨ c`.

  A pattern like `⟨a, b, c⟩ | ⟨d, e⟩` will do a split over the inductive datatype,
  naming the first three parameters of the first constructor as `a,b,c` and the
  first two of the second constructor `d,e`. If the list is not as long as the
  number of arguments to the constructor or the number of constructors, the
  remaining variables will be automatically named. If there are nested brackets
  such as `⟨⟨a⟩, b | c⟩ | d` then these will cause more case splits as necessary.
  If there are too many arguments, such as `⟨a, b, c⟩` for splitting on
  `∃ x, ∃ y, p x`, then it will be treated as `⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩`, splitting the last
  parameter as necessary.

  `rcases` also has special support for quotient types: quotient induction into Prop works like
  matching on the constructor `quot.mk`.

  `rcases h : e with PAT` will do the same as `rcases e with PAT` with the exception that an
  assumption `h : e = PAT` will be added to the context.

syntax "rcongr"... [Batteries.Tactic.rcongr]
  Repeatedly apply `congr` and `ext`, using the given patterns as arguments for `ext`.

  There are two ways this tactic stops:
  * `congr` fails (makes no progress), after having already applied `ext`.
  * `congr` canceled out the last usage of `ext`. In this case, the state is reverted to before
    the `congr` was applied.

  For example, when the goal is
  ```
  ⊢ (fun x => f x + 3) '' s = (fun x => g x + 3) '' s
  ```
  then `rcongr x` produces the goal
  ```
  x : α ⊢ f x = g x
  ```
  This gives the same result as `congr; ext x; congr`.

  In contrast, `congr` would produce
  ```
  ⊢ (fun x => f x + 3) = (fun x => g x + 3)
  ```
  and `congr with x` (or `congr; ext x`) would produce
  ```
  x : α ⊢ f x + 3 = g x + 3
  ```

syntax "recover"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticRecover_]
  Modifier `recover` for a tactic (sequence) to debug cases where goals are closed incorrectly.
  The tactic `recover tacs` for a tactic (sequence) `tacs` applies the tactics and then adds goals
  that are not closed, starting from the original goal.

syntax "reduce"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticReduce__]
  `reduce at loc` completely reduces the given location.
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

  This does the same transformation as the `#reduce` command.

syntax "reduce_mod_char"... [Tactic.ReduceModChar.reduce_mod_char]
  The tactic `reduce_mod_char` looks for numeric expressions in characteristic `p`
  and reduces these to lie between `0` and `p`.

  For example:
  ```
  example : (5 : ZMod 4) = 1 := by reduce_mod_char
  example : (X ^ 2 - 3 * X + 4 : (ZMod 4)[X]) = X ^ 2 + X := by reduce_mod_char
  ```

  It also handles negation, turning it into multiplication by `p - 1`,
  and similarly subtraction.

  This tactic uses the type of the subexpression to figure out if it is indeed of positive
  characteristic, for improved performance compared to trying to synthesise a `CharP` instance.
  The variant `reduce_mod_char!` also tries to use `CharP R n` hypotheses in the context.
  (Limitations of the typeclass system mean the tactic can't search for a `CharP R n` instance if
  `n` is not yet known; use `have : CharP R n := inferInstance; reduce_mod_char!` as a workaround.)

syntax "reduce_mod_char!"... [Tactic.ReduceModChar.reduce_mod_char!]
  The tactic `reduce_mod_char` looks for numeric expressions in characteristic `p`
  and reduces these to lie between `0` and `p`.

  For example:
  ```
  example : (5 : ZMod 4) = 1 := by reduce_mod_char
  example : (X ^ 2 - 3 * X + 4 : (ZMod 4)[X]) = X ^ 2 + X := by reduce_mod_char
  ```

  It also handles negation, turning it into multiplication by `p - 1`,
  and similarly subtraction.

  This tactic uses the type of the subexpression to figure out if it is indeed of positive
  characteristic, for improved performance compared to trying to synthesise a `CharP` instance.
  The variant `reduce_mod_char!` also tries to use `CharP R n` hypotheses in the context.
  (Limitations of the typeclass system mean the tactic can't search for a `CharP R n` instance if
  `n` is not yet known; use `have : CharP R n := inferInstance; reduce_mod_char!` as a workaround.)

syntax "refine"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.refine]
  `refine e` behaves like `exact e`, except that named (`?x`) or unnamed (`?_`)
  holes in `e` that are not solved by unification with the main goal's target type
  are converted into new goals, using the hole's name, if any, as the goal case name.

syntax "refine'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.refine']
  `refine' e` behaves like `refine e`, except that unsolved placeholders (`_`)
  and implicit parameters are also converted into new goals.

syntax "refine_lift"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRefine_lift_]
  Auxiliary macro for lifting have/suffices/let/...
  It makes sure the "continuation" `?_` is the main goal after refining.

syntax "refine_lift'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRefine_lift'_]
  Similar to `refine_lift`, but using `refine'`

syntax "refold_let"... [Mathlib.Tactic.refoldLetStx]
  `refold_let x y z at loc` looks for the bodies of local definitions `x`, `y`, and `z` at the given
  location and replaces them with `x`, `y`, or `z`. This is the inverse of "zeta reduction."
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

syntax "rel"... [Mathlib.Tactic.GCongr.«tacticRel[_]»]
  The `rel` tactic applies "generalized congruence" rules to solve a relational goal by
  "substitution".  For example,
  ```
  example {a b x c d : ℝ} (h1 : a ≤ b) (h2 : c ≤ d) :
      x ^ 2 * a + c ≤ x ^ 2 * b + d := by
    rel [h1, h2]
  ```
  In this example we "substitute" the hypotheses `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d` into the LHS `x ^ 2 * a + c` of
  the goal and obtain the RHS `x ^ 2 * b + d`, thus proving the goal.

  The "generalized congruence" rules used are the library lemmas which have been tagged with the
  attribute `@[gcongr]`.  For example, the first example constructs the proof term
  ```
  add_le_add (mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left h1 (pow_bit0_nonneg x 1)) h2
  ```
  using the generalized congruence lemmas `add_le_add` and `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`.  If there are
  no applicable generalized congruence lemmas, the tactic fails.

  The tactic attempts to discharge side goals to these "generalized congruence" lemmas (such as the
  side goal `0 ≤ x ^ 2` in the above application of `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left`) using the tactic
  `gcongr_discharger`, which wraps `positivity` but can also be extended. If the side goals cannot
  be discharged in this way, the tactic fails.

syntax "rename"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rename]
  `rename t => x` renames the most recent hypothesis whose type matches `t`
  (which may contain placeholders) to `x`, or fails if no such hypothesis could be found.

syntax "rename'"... [Mathlib.Tactic.rename']
  `rename' h => hnew` renames the hypothesis named `h` to `hnew`.
  To rename several hypothesis, use `rename' h₁ => h₁new, h₂ => h₂new`.
  You can use `rename' a => b, b => a` to swap two variables.

syntax "rename_bvar"... [Mathlib.Tactic.«tacticRename_bvar_→__»]
  * `rename_bvar old → new` renames all bound variables named `old` to `new` in the target.
  * `rename_bvar old → new at h` does the same in hypothesis `h`.

  ```lean
  example (P : ℕ → ℕ → Prop) (h : ∀ n, ∃ m, P n m) : ∀ l, ∃ m, P l m := by
    rename_bvar n → q at h -- h is now ∀ (q : ℕ), ∃ (m : ℕ), P q m,
    rename_bvar m → n -- target is now ∀ (l : ℕ), ∃ (n : ℕ), P k n,
    exact h -- Lean does not care about those bound variable names
  ```
  Note: name clashes are resolved automatically.

syntax "rename_i"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.renameI]
  `rename_i x_1 ... x_n` renames the last `n` inaccessible names using the given names.

syntax "repeat"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRepeat_]
  `repeat tac` repeatedly applies `tac` so long as it succeeds.
  The tactic `tac` may be a tactic sequence, and if `tac` fails at any point in its execution,
  `repeat` will revert any partial changes that `tac` made to the tactic state.

  The tactic `tac` should eventually fail, otherwise `repeat tac` will run indefinitely.

  See also:
  * `try tac` is like `repeat tac` but will apply `tac` at most once.
  * `repeat' tac` recursively applies `tac` to each goal.
  * `first | tac1 | tac2` implements the backtracking used by `repeat`

syntax "repeat'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.repeat']
  `repeat' tac` recursively applies `tac` on all of the goals so long as it succeeds.
  That is to say, if `tac` produces multiple subgoals, then `repeat' tac` is applied to each of them.

  See also:
  * `repeat tac` simply repeatedly applies `tac`.
  * `repeat1' tac` is `repeat' tac` but requires that `tac` succeed for some goal at least once.

syntax "repeat1"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticRepeat1_]
  `repeat1 tac` applies `tac` to main goal at least once. If the application succeeds,
  the tactic is applied recursively to the generated subgoals until it eventually fails.

syntax "repeat1'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.repeat1']
  `repeat1' tac` recursively applies to `tac` on all of the goals so long as it succeeds,
  but `repeat1' tac` fails if `tac` succeeds on none of the initial goals.

  See also:
  * `repeat tac` simply applies `tac` repeatedly.
  * `repeat' tac` is like `repeat1' tac` but it does not require that `tac` succeed at least once.

syntax "replace"... [Mathlib.Tactic.replace']
  Acts like `have`, but removes a hypothesis with the same name as
  this one if possible. For example, if the state is:

  Then after `replace h : β` the state will be:

  ```lean
  case h
  f : α → β
  h : α
  ⊢ β

  f : α → β
  h : β
  ⊢ goal
  ```

  whereas `have h : β` would result in:

  ```lean
  case h
  f : α → β
  h : α
  ⊢ β

  f : α → β
  h✝ : α
  h : β
  ⊢ goal
  ```

syntax "replace"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.replace]
  Acts like `have`, but removes a hypothesis with the same name as
  this one if possible. For example, if the state is:

  ```lean
  f : α → β
  h : α
  ⊢ goal
  ```

  Then after `replace h := f h` the state will be:

  ```lean
  f : α → β
  h : β
  ⊢ goal
  ```

  whereas `have h := f h` would result in:

  ```lean
  f : α → β
  h† : α
  h : β
  ⊢ goal
  ```

  This can be used to simulate the `specialize` and `apply at` tactics of Coq.

syntax "restrict_tac"... [TopCat.Presheaf.restrict_tac]
  `restrict_tac` solves relations among subsets (copied from `aesop cat`)

syntax "restrict_tac?"... [TopCat.Presheaf.restrict_tac?]
  `restrict_tac?` passes along `Try this` from `aesop`

syntax "revert"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.revert]
  `revert x...` is the inverse of `intro x...`: it moves the given hypotheses
  into the main goal's target type.

syntax "rewrite"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rewriteSeq]
  `rewrite [e]` applies identity `e` as a rewrite rule to the target of the main goal.
  If `e` is preceded by left arrow (`←` or `<-`), the rewrite is applied in the reverse direction.
  If `e` is a defined constant, then the equational theorems associated with `e` are used.
  This provides a convenient way to unfold `e`.
  - `rewrite [e₁, ..., eₙ]` applies the given rules sequentially.
  - `rewrite [e] at l` rewrites `e` at location(s) `l`, where `l` is either `*` or a
    list of hypotheses in the local context. In the latter case, a turnstile `⊢` or `|-`
    can also be used, to signify the target of the goal.

  Using `rw (occs := .pos L) [e]`,
  where `L : List Nat`, you can control which "occurrences" are rewritten.
  (This option applies to each rule, so usually this will only be used with a single rule.)
  Occurrences count from `1`.
  At each allowed occurrence, arguments of the rewrite rule `e` may be instantiated,
  restricting which later rewrites can be found.
  (Disallowed occurrences do not result in instantiation.)
  `(occs := .neg L)` allows skipping specified occurrences.

syntax "rewrite!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.DepRewrite.depRewriteSeq]
  `rewrite!` is like `rewrite`,
  but can also insert casts to adjust types that depend on the LHS of a rewrite.
  It is available as an ordinary tactic and a `conv` tactic.

  The sort of casts that are inserted is controlled by the `castMode` configuration option.
  By default, only proof terms are casted;
  by proof irrelevance, this adds no observable complexity.

  With `rewrite! +letAbs (castMode := .all)`, casts are inserted whenever necessary.
  This means that the 'motive is not type correct' error never occurs,
  at the expense of creating potentially complicated terms.

syntax "rfl"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRfl]
  This tactic applies to a goal whose target has the form `x ~ x`,
  where `~` is equality, heterogeneous equality or any relation that
  has a reflexivity lemma tagged with the attribute @[refl].

syntax "rfl'"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRfl']
  `rfl'` is similar to `rfl`, but disables smart unfolding and unfolds all kinds of definitions,
  theorems included (relevant for declarations defined by well-founded recursion).

syntax "rfl_cat"... [CategoryTheory.rfl_cat]
  `rfl_cat` is a macro for `intros; rfl` which is attempted in `aesop_cat` before
  doing the more expensive `aesop` tactic.

  This gives a speedup because `simp` (called by `aesop`) can be very slow.
  https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/25475 contains measurements from June 2025.

  Implementation notes:
  * `refine id ?_`:
    In some cases it is important that the type of the proof matches the expected type exactly.
    e.g. if the goal is `2 = 1 + 1`, the `rfl` tactic will give a proof of type `2 = 2`.
    Starting a proof with `refine id ?_` is a trick to make sure that the proof has exactly
    the expected type, in this case `2 = 1 + 1`. See also
    https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/270676-lean4/topic/changing.20a.20proof.20can.20break.20a.20later.20proof
  * `apply_rfl`:
    `rfl` is a macro that attempts both `eq_refl` and `apply_rfl`. Since `apply_rfl`
    subsumes `eq_refl`, we can use `apply_rfl` instead. This fails twice as fast as `rfl`.

syntax "rify"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Rify.rify]
  The `rify` tactic is used to shift propositions from `ℕ`, `ℤ` or `ℚ` to `ℝ`.
  Although less useful than its cousins `zify` and `qify`, it can be useful when your
  goal or context already involves real numbers.

  In the example below, assumption `hn` is about natural numbers, `hk` is about integers
  and involves casting a natural number to `ℤ`, and the conclusion is about real numbers.
  The proof uses `rify` to lift both assumptions to `ℝ` before calling `linarith`.
  ```
  example {n : ℕ} {k : ℤ} (hn : 8 ≤ n) (hk : 2 * k ≤ n + 2) :
      (0 : ℝ) < n - k - 1 := by
    rify at hn hk
```
 Now have hn : 8 ≤ (n : ℝ)   hk : 2 * (k : ℝ) ≤ (n : ℝ) + 2 
```lean
linarith
  ```

  `rify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]`, `@[qify_simps]` and `@[rify_simps]` attributes to move
  propositions, and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `ℝ`-valued expressions.

  `rify` can be given extra lemmas to use in simplification. This is especially useful in the
  presence of nat subtraction: passing `≤` arguments will allow `push_cast` to do more work.
  ```
  example (a b c : ℕ) (h : a - b < c) (hab : b ≤ a) : a < b + c := by
    rify [hab] at h ⊢
    linarith
  ```
  Note that `zify` or `qify` would work just as well in the above example (and `zify` is the natural
  choice since it is enough to get rid of the pathological `ℕ` subtraction).

syntax "right"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.right]
  Applies the second constructor when
  the goal is an inductive type with exactly two constructors, or fails otherwise.
  ```
  example {p q : Prop} (h : q) : p ∨ q := by
    right
    exact h
  ```

syntax "ring"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RingNF.ring]
  Tactic for evaluating expressions in *commutative* (semi)rings, allowing for variables in the
  exponent. If the goal is not appropriate for `ring` (e.g. not an equality) `ring_nf` will be
  suggested.

  * `ring!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting to determine equality of atoms.
  * `ring1` fails if the target is not an equality.

  For example:
  ```
  example (n : ℕ) (m : ℤ) : 2^(n+1) * m = 2 * 2^n * m := by ring
  example (a b : ℤ) (n : ℕ) : (a + b)^(n + 2) = (a^2 + b^2 + a * b + b * a) * (a + b)^n := by ring
  example (x y : ℕ) : x + id y = y + id x := by ring!
  example (x : ℕ) (h : x * 2 > 5): x + x > 5 := by ring; assumption -- suggests ring_nf
  ```

syntax "ring!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RingNF.tacticRing!]
  Tactic for evaluating expressions in *commutative* (semi)rings, allowing for variables in the
  exponent. If the goal is not appropriate for `ring` (e.g. not an equality) `ring_nf` will be
  suggested.

  * `ring!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting to determine equality of atoms.
  * `ring1` fails if the target is not an equality.

  For example:
  ```
  example (n : ℕ) (m : ℤ) : 2^(n+1) * m = 2 * 2^n * m := by ring
  example (a b : ℤ) (n : ℕ) : (a + b)^(n + 2) = (a^2 + b^2 + a * b + b * a) * (a + b)^n := by ring
  example (x y : ℕ) : x + id y = y + id x := by ring!
  example (x : ℕ) (h : x * 2 > 5): x + x > 5 := by ring; assumption -- suggests ring_nf
  ```

syntax "ring1"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Ring.ring1]
  Tactic for solving equations of *commutative* (semi)rings,
  allowing variables in the exponent.

  * This version of `ring` fails if the target is not an equality.
  * The variant `ring1!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting
    to determine equality of atoms.

syntax "ring1!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Ring.tacticRing1!]
  Tactic for solving equations of *commutative* (semi)rings,
  allowing variables in the exponent.

  * This version of `ring` fails if the target is not an equality.
  * The variant `ring1!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting
    to determine equality of atoms.

syntax "ring1_nf"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RingNF.ring1NF]
  Tactic for solving equations of *commutative* (semi)rings, allowing variables in the exponent.

  * This version of `ring1` uses `ring_nf` to simplify in atoms.
  * The variant `ring1_nf!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting
    to determine equality of atoms.

syntax "ring1_nf!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RingNF.tacticRing1_nf!_]
  Tactic for solving equations of *commutative* (semi)rings, allowing variables in the exponent.

  * This version of `ring1` uses `ring_nf` to simplify in atoms.
  * The variant `ring1_nf!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting
    to determine equality of atoms.

syntax "ring_nf"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RingNF.ringNF]
  Simplification tactic for expressions in the language of commutative (semi)rings,
  which rewrites all ring expressions into a normal form.
  * `ring_nf!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting to identify atoms.
  * `ring_nf (config := cfg)` allows for additional configuration:
    * `red`: the reducibility setting (overridden by `!`)
    * `zetaDelta`: if true, local let variables can be unfolded (overridden by `!`)
    * `recursive`: if true, `ring_nf` will also recurse into atoms
  * `ring_nf` works as both a tactic and a conv tactic.
    In tactic mode, `ring_nf at h` can be used to rewrite in a hypothesis.

  This can be used non-terminally to normalize ring expressions in the goal such as
  `⊢ P (x + x + x)` ~> `⊢ P (x * 3)`, as well as being able to prove some equations that
  `ring` cannot because they involve ring reasoning inside a subterm, such as
  `sin (x + y) + sin (y + x) = 2 * sin (x + y)`.

syntax "ring_nf!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RingNF.tacticRing_nf!__]
  Simplification tactic for expressions in the language of commutative (semi)rings,
  which rewrites all ring expressions into a normal form.
  * `ring_nf!` will use a more aggressive reducibility setting to identify atoms.
  * `ring_nf (config := cfg)` allows for additional configuration:
    * `red`: the reducibility setting (overridden by `!`)
    * `zetaDelta`: if true, local let variables can be unfolded (overridden by `!`)

  `ring` cannot because they involve ring reasoning inside a subterm, such as
  `sin (x + y) + sin (y + x) = 2 * sin (x + y)`.

syntax "rintro"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rintro]
  The `rintro` tactic is a combination of the `intros` tactic with `rcases` to
  allow for destructuring patterns while introducing variables. See `rcases` for
  a description of supported patterns. For example, `rintro (a | ⟨b, c⟩) ⟨d, e⟩`
  will introduce two variables, and then do case splits on both of them producing
  two subgoals, one with variables `a d e` and the other with `b c d e`.

  `rintro`, unlike `rcases`, also supports the form `(x y : ty)` for introducing
  and type-ascripting multiple variables at once, similar to binders.

syntax "rotate_left"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rotateLeft]
  `rotate_left n` rotates goals to the left by `n`. That is, `rotate_left 1`
  takes the main goal and puts it to the back of the subgoal list.
  If `n` is omitted, it defaults to `1`.

syntax "rotate_right"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rotateRight]
  Rotate the goals to the right by `n`. That is, take the goal at the back
  and push it to the front `n` times. If `n` is omitted, it defaults to `1`.

syntax "rsuffices"... [Mathlib.Tactic.rsuffices]
  The `rsuffices` tactic is an alternative version of `suffices`, that allows the usage
  of any syntax that would be valid in an `obtain` block. This tactic just calls `obtain`
  on the expression, and then `rotate_left`.

syntax "run_tac"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.runTac]
  The `run_tac doSeq` tactic executes code in `TacticM Unit`.

syntax "rw"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rwSeq]
  `rw` is like `rewrite`, but also tries to close the goal by "cheap" (reducible) `rfl` afterwards.

syntax "rw!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.DepRewrite.depRwSeq]
  `rw!` is like `rewrite!`, but also calls `dsimp` to simplify the result after every substitution.
  It is available as an ordinary tactic and a `conv` tactic.

syntax "rw?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.rewrites?]
  `rw?` tries to find a lemma which can rewrite the goal.

  `rw?` should not be left in proofs; it is a search tool, like `apply?`.

  Suggestions are printed as `rw [h]` or `rw [← h]`.

  You can use `rw? [-my_lemma, -my_theorem]` to prevent `rw?` using the named lemmas.

syntax "rw??"... [Mathlib.Tactic.LibraryRewrite.tacticRw??]
  `rw??` is an interactive tactic that suggests rewrites for any expression selected by the user.
  To use it, shift-click an expression in the goal or a hypothesis that you want to rewrite.
  Clicking on one of the rewrite suggestions will paste the relevant rewrite tactic into the editor.

  The rewrite suggestions are grouped and sorted by the pattern that the rewrite lemmas match with.
  Rewrites that don't change the goal and rewrites that create the same goal as another rewrite
  are filtered out, as well as rewrites that have new metavariables in the replacement expression.
  To see all suggestions, click on the filter button (▼) in the top right.

syntax "rw_mod_cast"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRw_mod_cast___]
  Rewrites with the given rules, normalizing casts prior to each step.

syntax "rw_search"... [Mathlib.Tactic.RewriteSearch.tacticRw_search_]
  `rw_search` has been removed from Mathlib.

syntax "rwa"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticRwa__]
  `rwa` is short-hand for `rw; assumption`.

syntax "saturate"... [Aesop.Frontend.tacticSaturate_____]

syntax "saturate?"... [Aesop.Frontend.tacticSaturate?_____]

syntax "says"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Says.says]
  If you write `X says`, where `X` is a tactic that produces a "Try this: Y" message,
  then you will get a message "Try this: X says Y".
  Once you've clicked to replace `X says` with `X says Y`,
  afterwards `X says Y` will only run `Y`.

  The typical usage case is:
  ```
  simp? [X] says simp only [X, Y, Z]
  ```

  If you use `set_option says.verify true` (set automatically during CI) then `X says Y`
  runs `X` and verifies that it still prints "Try this: Y".

syntax "set"... [Mathlib.Tactic.setTactic]
  `set a := t with h` is a variant of `let a := t`. It adds the hypothesis `h : a = t` to
  the local context and replaces `t` with `a` everywhere it can.

  `set a := t with ← h` will add `h : t = a` instead.

  `set! a := t with h` does not do any replacing.

  ```lean
  example (x : Nat) (h : x + x - x = 3) : x + x - x = 3 := by
    set y := x with ← h2
    sorry
```

  x : Nat
  y : Nat := x
  h : y + y - y = 3
  h2 : x = y
  ⊢ y + y - y = 3
  
```lean
```

syntax "set!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticSet!_]
  `set a := t with h` is a variant of `let a := t`. It adds the hypothesis `h : a = t` to
  the local context and replaces `t` with `a` everywhere it can.

  `set a := t with ← h` will add `h : t = a` instead.

  `set! a := t with h` does not do any replacing.

  ```lean
  example (x : Nat) (h : x + x - x = 3) : x + x - x = 3 := by
    set y := x with ← h2
    sorry
```

  x : Nat
  y : Nat := x
  h : y + y - y = 3
  h2 : x = y
  ⊢ y + y - y = 3
  
```lean
```

syntax "set_option"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.set_option]
  `set_option opt val in tacs` (the tactic) acts like `set_option opt val` at the command level,
  but it sets the option only within the tactics `tacs`.

syntax "show"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.show]
  `show t` finds the first goal whose target unifies with `t`. It makes that the main goal,
  performs the unification, and replaces the target with the unified version of `t`.

syntax "show_term"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.showTerm]
  `show_term tac` runs `tac`, then prints the generated term in the form
  "exact X Y Z" or "refine X ?_ Z" (prefixed by `expose_names` if necessary)
  if there are remaining subgoals.

  (For some tactics, the printed term will not be human readable.)

syntax "simp"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simp]
  The `simp` tactic uses lemmas and hypotheses to simplify the main goal target or
  non-dependent hypotheses. It has many variants:
  - `simp` simplifies the main goal target using lemmas tagged with the attribute `[simp]`.
  - `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged
    with the attribute `[simp]` and the given `hᵢ`'s, where the `hᵢ`'s are expressions.-
  - If an `hᵢ` is a defined constant `f`, then `f` is unfolded. If `f` has equational lemmas associated
    with it (and is not a projection or a `reducible` definition), these are used to rewrite with `f`.
  - `simp [*]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged with the
    attribute `[simp]` and all hypotheses.
  - `simp only [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` is like `simp [h₁, h₂, ..., hₙ]` but does not use `[simp]` lemmas.
  - `simp [-id₁, ..., -idₙ]` simplifies the main goal target using the lemmas tagged
    with the attribute `[simp]`, but removes the ones named `idᵢ`.
  - `simp at h₁ h₂ ... hₙ` simplifies the hypotheses `h₁ : T₁` ... `hₙ : Tₙ`. If
    the target or another hypothesis depends on `hᵢ`, a new simplified hypothesis
    `hᵢ` is introduced, but the old one remains in the local context.
  - `simp at *` simplifies all the hypotheses and the target.
  - `simp [*] at *` simplifies target and all (propositional) hypotheses using the
    other hypotheses.

syntax "simp!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpAutoUnfold]
  `simp!` is shorthand for `simp` with `autoUnfold := true`.
  This will unfold applications of functions defined by pattern matching, when one of the patterns applies.
  This can be used to partially evaluate many definitions.

syntax "simp?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpTrace]
  `simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
  set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
  ```
  example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
    simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
  ```

  This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

syntax "simp?!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSimp?!_]
  `simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
  set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
  ```
  example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
    simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
  ```

  This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

syntax "simp_all"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpAll]
  `simp_all` is a stronger version of `simp [*] at *` where the hypotheses and target
  are simplified multiple times until no simplification is applicable.
  Only non-dependent propositional hypotheses are considered.

syntax "simp_all!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpAllAutoUnfold]
  `simp_all!` is shorthand for `simp_all` with `autoUnfold := true`.
  This will unfold applications of functions defined by pattern matching, when one of the patterns applies.
  This can be used to partially evaluate many definitions.

syntax "simp_all?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpAllTrace]
  `simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
  set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
  ```
  example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
    simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
  ```

  This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

syntax "simp_all?!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSimp_all?!_]
  `simp?` takes the same arguments as `simp`, but reports an equivalent call to `simp only`
  that would be sufficient to close the goal. This is useful for reducing the size of the simp
  set in a local invocation to speed up processing.
  ```
  example (x : Nat) : (if True then x + 2 else 3) = x + 2 := by
    simp? -- prints "Try this: simp only [ite_true]"
  ```

  This command can also be used in `simp_all` and `dsimp`.

syntax "simp_all_arith"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpAllArith]
  `simp_all_arith` has been deprecated. It was a shorthand for `simp_all +arith +decide`.
  Note that `+decide` is not needed for reducing arithmetic terms since simprocs have been added to Lean.

syntax "simp_all_arith!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpAllArithBang]
  `simp_all_arith!` has been deprecated. It was a shorthand for `simp_all! +arith +decide`.
  Note that `+decide` is not needed for reducing arithmetic terms since simprocs have been added to Lean.

syntax "simp_arith"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpArith]
  `simp_arith` has been deprecated. It was a shorthand for `simp +arith +decide`.
  Note that `+decide` is not needed for reducing arithmetic terms since simprocs have been added to Lean.

syntax "simp_arith!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpArithBang]
  `simp_arith!` has been deprecated. It was a shorthand for `simp! +arith +decide`.
  Note that `+decide` is not needed for reducing arithmetic terms since simprocs have been added to Lean.

syntax "simp_intro"... [Mathlib.Tactic.«tacticSimp_intro_____..Only_»]
  The `simp_intro` tactic is a combination of `simp` and `intro`: it will simplify the types of
  variables as it introduces them and uses the new variables to simplify later arguments
  and the goal.
  * `simp_intro x y z` introduces variables named `x y z`
  * `simp_intro x y z ..` introduces variables named `x y z` and then keeps introducing `_` binders
  * `simp_intro (config := cfg) (discharger := tac) x y .. only [h₁, h₂]`:
    `simp_intro` takes the same options as `simp` (see `simp`)
  ```
  example : x + 0 = y → x = z := by
    simp_intro h
    -- h: x = y ⊢ y = z
    sorry
  ```

syntax "simp_rw"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticSimp_rw___]
  `simp_rw` functions as a mix of `simp` and `rw`. Like `rw`, it applies each
  rewrite rule in the given order, but like `simp` it repeatedly applies these
  rules and also under binders like `∀ x, ...`, `∃ x, ...` and `fun x ↦...`.
  Usage:

  - `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n]` will rewrite the goal by applying the
    lemmas in that order. A lemma preceded by `←` is applied in the reverse direction.
  - `simp_rw [lemma_1, ..., lemma_n] at h₁ ... hₙ` will rewrite the given hypotheses.
  - `simp_rw [...] at *` rewrites in the whole context: all hypotheses and the goal.

  Lemmas passed to `simp_rw` must be expressions that are valid arguments to `simp`.
  For example, neither `simp` nor `rw` can solve the following, but `simp_rw` can:

  ```lean
  example {a : ℕ}
      (h1 : ∀ a b : ℕ, a - 1 ≤ b ↔ a ≤ b + 1)
      (h2 : ∀ a b : ℕ, a ≤ b ↔ ∀ c, c < a → c < b) :
      (∀ b, a - 1 ≤ b) = ∀ b c : ℕ, c < a → c < b + 1 := by
    simp_rw [h1, h2]
  ```

syntax "simp_wf"... [tacticSimp_wf]
  Unfold definitions commonly used in well founded relation definitions.

  Since Lean 4.12, Lean unfolds these definitions automatically before presenting the goal to the
  user, and this tactic should no longer be necessary. Calls to `simp_wf` can be removed or replaced
  by plain calls to `simp`.

syntax "simpa"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.simpa]
  This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of
  `e` using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal
  (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be
  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a
  hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using
  the `assumption` tactic.

syntax "simpa!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSimpa!_]
  This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of
  `e` using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal
  (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be
  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a
  hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using
  the `assumption` tactic.

syntax "simpa?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSimpa?_]
  This is a "finishing" tactic modification of `simp`. It has two forms.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯] using e` will simplify the goal and the type of
  `e` using `rules`, then try to close the goal using `e`.

  Simplifying the type of `e` makes it more likely to match the goal
  (which has also been simplified). This construction also tends to be
  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a
  hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using
  the `assumption` tactic.

syntax "simpa?!"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSimpa?!_]

  more robust under changes to the simp lemma set.

  * `simpa [rules, ⋯]` will simplify the goal and the type of a
  hypothesis `this` if present in the context, then try to close the goal using
  the `assumption` tactic.

syntax "sizeOf_list_dec"... [List.tacticSizeOf_list_dec]
  This tactic, added to the `decreasing_trivial` toolbox, proves that
  `sizeOf a < sizeOf as` when `a ∈ as`, which is useful for well founded recursions
  over a nested inductive like `inductive T | mk : List T → T`.

syntax "skip"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.skip]
  `skip` does nothing.

syntax "sleep"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.sleep]
  The tactic `sleep ms` sleeps for `ms` milliseconds and does nothing.
  It is used for debugging purposes only.

syntax "sleep_heartbeats"... [tacticSleep_heartbeats_]
  do nothing for at least n heartbeats

syntax "slice_lhs"... [sliceLHS]
  `slice_lhs a b => tac` zooms to the left-hand side, uses associativity for categorical
  composition as needed, zooms in on the `a`-th through `b`-th morphisms, and invokes `tac`.

syntax "slice_rhs"... [sliceRHS]
  `slice_rhs a b => tac` zooms to the right-hand side, uses associativity for categorical
  composition as needed, zooms in on the `a`-th through `b`-th morphisms, and invokes `tac`.

syntax "smul_tac"... [RatFunc.tacticSmul_tac]
  Solve equations for `RatFunc K` by applying `RatFunc.induction_on`.

syntax "solve"... [Lean.solveTactic]
  Similar to `first`, but succeeds only if one the given tactics solves the current goal.

syntax "solve_by_elim"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.solveByElim]
  `solve_by_elim` calls `apply` on the main goal to find an assumption whose head matches
  and then repeatedly calls `apply` on the generated subgoals until no subgoals remain,
  performing at most `maxDepth` (defaults to 6) recursive steps.

  `solve_by_elim` discharges the current goal or fails.

  `solve_by_elim` performs backtracking if subgoals can not be solved.

  By default, the assumptions passed to `apply` are the local context, `rfl`, `trivial`,
  `congrFun` and `congrArg`.

  The assumptions can be modified with similar syntax as for `simp`:
  * `solve_by_elim [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` also applies the given expressions.
  * `solve_by_elim only [h₁, h₂, ..., hᵣ]` does not include the local context,
    `rfl`, `trivial`, `congrFun`, or `congrArg` unless they are explicitly included.
  * `solve_by_elim [-h₁, ... -hₙ]` removes the given local hypotheses.
  * `solve_by_elim using [a₁, ...]` uses all lemmas which have been labelled
    with the attributes `aᵢ` (these attributes must be created using `register_label_attr`).

  `solve_by_elim*` tries to solve all goals together, using backtracking if a solution for one goal
  makes other goals impossible.
  (Adding or removing local hypotheses may not be well-behaved when starting with multiple goals.)

  Optional arguments passed via a configuration argument as `solve_by_elim (config := { ... })`
  - `maxDepth`: number of attempts at discharging generated subgoals
  - `symm`: adds all hypotheses derived by `symm` (defaults to `true`).
  - `exfalso`: allow calling `exfalso` and trying again if `solve_by_elim` fails
    (defaults to `true`).
  - `transparency`: change the transparency mode when calling `apply`. Defaults to `.default`,
    but it is often useful to change to `.reducible`,
    so semireducible definitions will not be unfolded when trying to apply a lemma.

  See also the doc-comment for `Lean.Meta.Tactic.Backtrack.BacktrackConfig` for the options
  `proc`, `suspend`, and `discharge` which allow further customization of `solve_by_elim`.
  Both `apply_assumption` and `apply_rules` are implemented via these hooks.

syntax "sorry"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSorry]
  The `sorry` tactic is a temporary placeholder for an incomplete tactic proof,
  closing the main goal using `exact sorry`.

  This is intended for stubbing-out incomplete parts of a proof while still having a syntactically correct proof skeleton.
  Lean will give a warning whenever a proof uses `sorry`, so you aren't likely to miss it,
  but you can double check if a theorem depends on `sorry` by looking for `sorryAx` in the output
  of the `#print axioms my_thm` command, the axiom used by the implementation of `sorry`.

syntax "sorry_if_sorry"... [CategoryTheory.sorryIfSorry]
  Close the main goal with `sorry` if its type contains `sorry`, and fail otherwise.

syntax "specialize"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.specialize]
  The tactic `specialize h a₁ ... aₙ` works on local hypothesis `h`.
  The premises of this hypothesis, either universal quantifications or
  non-dependent implications, are instantiated by concrete terms coming
  from arguments `a₁` ... `aₙ`.
  The tactic adds a new hypothesis with the same name `h := h a₁ ... aₙ`
  and tries to clear the previous one.

syntax "specialize_all"... [Mathlib.Tactic.TautoSet.specialize_all]
  `specialize_all x` runs `specialize h x` for all hypotheses `h` where this tactic succeeds.

syntax "split"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.split]
  The `split` tactic is useful for breaking nested if-then-else and `match` expressions into separate cases.
  For a `match` expression with `n` cases, the `split` tactic generates at most `n` subgoals.

  For example, given `n : Nat`, and a target `if n = 0 then Q else R`, `split` will generate
  one goal with hypothesis `n = 0` and target `Q`, and a second goal with hypothesis
  `¬n = 0` and target `R`.  Note that the introduced hypothesis is unnamed, and is commonly
  renamed using the `case` or `next` tactics.

  - `split` will split the goal (target).
  - `split at h` will split the hypothesis `h`.

syntax "split_ands"... [Batteries.Tactic.tacticSplit_ands]
  `split_ands` applies `And.intro` until it does not make progress.

syntax "split_ifs"... [Mathlib.Tactic.splitIfs]
  Splits all if-then-else-expressions into multiple goals.
  Given a goal of the form `g (if p then x else y)`, `split_ifs` will produce
  two goals: `p ⊢ g x` and `¬p ⊢ g y`.
  If there are multiple ite-expressions, then `split_ifs` will split them all,
  starting with a top-most one whose condition does not contain another
  ite-expression.
  `split_ifs at *` splits all ite-expressions in all hypotheses as well as the goal.
  `split_ifs with h₁ h₂ h₃` overrides the default names for the hypotheses.

syntax "squeeze_scope"... [Batteries.Tactic.squeezeScope]
  The `squeeze_scope` tactic allows aggregating multiple calls to `simp` coming from the same syntax
  but in different branches of execution, such as in `cases x <;> simp`.
  The reported `simp` call covers all simp lemmas used by this syntax.
  ```
  @[simp] def bar (z : Nat) := 1 + z
  @[simp] def baz (z : Nat) := 1 + z

  @[simp] def foo : Nat → Nat → Nat
    | 0, z => bar z
    | _+1, z => baz z

  example : foo x y = 1 + y := by
    cases x <;> simp? -- two printouts:
    -- "Try this: simp only [foo, bar]"
    -- "Try this: simp only [foo, baz]"

  example : foo x y = 1 + y := by
    squeeze_scope
      cases x <;> simp -- only one printout: "Try this: simp only [foo, baz, bar]"
  ```

syntax "stop"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticStop_]
  `stop` is a helper tactic for "discarding" the rest of a proof:
  it is defined as `repeat sorry`.
  It is useful when working on the middle of a complex proofs,
  and less messy than commenting the remainder of the proof.

syntax "subsingleton"... [Mathlib.Tactic.subsingletonStx]
  The `subsingleton` tactic tries to prove a goal of the form `x = y` or `x ≍ y`
  using the fact that the types involved are *subsingletons*
  (a type with exactly zero or one terms).
  To a first approximation, it does `apply Subsingleton.elim`.
  As a nicety, `subsingleton` first runs the `intros` tactic.

  - If the goal is an equality, it either closes the goal or fails.
  - `subsingleton [inst1, inst2, ...]` can be used to add additional `Subsingleton` instances
    to the local context. This can be more flexible than
    `have := inst1; have := inst2; ...; subsingleton` since the tactic does not require that
    all placeholders be solved for.

  Techniques the `subsingleton` tactic can apply:
  - proof irrelevance
  - heterogeneous proof irrelevance (via `proof_irrel_heq`)
  - using `Subsingleton` (via `Subsingleton.elim`)
  - proving `BEq` instances are equal if they are both lawful (via `lawful_beq_subsingleton`)

  ### Properties

  The tactic is careful not to accidentally specialize `Sort _` to `Prop`,
  avoiding the following surprising behavior of `apply Subsingleton.elim`:
  ```lean
  example (α : Sort _) (x y : α) : x = y := by apply Subsingleton.elim
  ```
  The reason this `example` goes through is that
  it applies the `∀ (p : Prop), Subsingleton p` instance,
  specializing the universe level metavariable in `Sort _` to `0`.

syntax "subst"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.subst]
  `subst x...` substitutes each hypothesis `x` with a definition found in the local context,
  then eliminates the hypothesis.
  - If `x` is a local definition, then its definition is used.
  - Otherwise, if there is a hypothesis of the form `x = e` or `e = x`,
    then `e` is used for the definition of `x`.

  If `h : a = b`, then `subst h` may be used if either `a` or `b` unfolds to a local hypothesis.
  This is similar to the `cases h` tactic.

  See also: `subst_vars` for substituting all local hypotheses that have a defining equation.

syntax "subst_eqs"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.substEqs]
  `subst_eq` repeatedly substitutes according to the equality proof hypotheses in the context,
  replacing the left side of the equality with the right, until no more progress can be made.

syntax "subst_hom_lift"... [CategoryTheory.tacticSubst_hom_lift___]
  `subst_hom_lift p f φ` tries to substitute `f` with `p(φ)` by using `p.IsHomLift f φ`

syntax "subst_vars"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.substVars]
  Applies `subst` to all hypotheses of the form `h : x = t` or `h : t = x`.

syntax "substs"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Substs.substs]
  Applies the `subst` tactic to all given hypotheses from left to right.

syntax "success_if_fail_with_msg"... [Mathlib.Tactic.successIfFailWithMsg]
  `success_if_fail_with_msg msg tacs` runs `tacs` and succeeds only if they fail with the message
  `msg`.

  `msg` can be any term that evaluates to an explicit `String`.

syntax "suffices"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticSuffices_]
  Given a main goal `ctx ⊢ t`, `suffices h : t' from e` replaces the main goal with `ctx ⊢ t'`,
  `e` must have type `t` in the context `ctx, h : t'`.

  The variant `suffices h : t' by tac` is a shorthand for `suffices h : t' from by tac`.
  If `h :` is omitted, the name `this` is used.

syntax "suffices"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticSuffices_]
  Given a main goal `ctx ⊢ t`, `suffices h : t' from e` replaces the main goal with `ctx ⊢ t'`,
  `e` must have type `t` in the context `ctx, h : t'`.

  The variant `suffices h : t' by tac` is a shorthand for `suffices h : t' from by tac`.
  If `h :` is omitted, the name `this` is used.

syntax "suggestions"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.suggestions]
  `#suggestions` will suggest relevant theorems from the library for the current goal,
  using the currently registered library suggestion engine.

  The suggestions are printed in the order of their confidence, from highest to lowest.

syntax "swap"... [Batteries.Tactic.tacticSwap]
  `swap` is a shortcut for `pick_goal 2`, which interchanges the 1st and 2nd goals.

syntax "swap_var"... [Mathlib.Tactic.«tacticSwap_var__,,»]
  `swap_var swap_rule₁, swap_rule₂, ⋯` applies `swap_rule₁` then `swap_rule₂` then `⋯`.

  A *swap_rule* is of the form `x y` or `x ↔ y`, and "applying it" means swapping the variable name
  `x` by `y` and vice-versa on all hypotheses and the goal.

  ```lean
  example {P Q : Prop} (q : P) (p : Q) : P ∧ Q := by
    swap_var p ↔ q
    exact ⟨p, q⟩
  ```

syntax "symm"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.symm]
  * `symm` applies to a goal whose target has the form `t ~ u` where `~` is a symmetric relation,
    that is, a relation which has a symmetry lemma tagged with the attribute [symm].
    It replaces the target with `u ~ t`.
  * `symm at h` will rewrite a hypothesis `h : t ~ u` to `h : u ~ t`.

syntax "symm_saturate"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.symmSaturate]
  For every hypothesis `h : a ~ b` where a `@[symm]` lemma is available,
  add a hypothesis `h_symm : b ~ a`.

syntax "tauto"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Tauto.tauto]
  `tauto` breaks down assumptions of the form `_ ∧ _`, `_ ∨ _`, `_ ↔ _` and `∃ _, _`
  and splits a goal of the form `_ ∧ _`, `_ ↔ _` or `∃ _, _` until it can be discharged
  using `rfl` or `solve_by_elim`.
  This is a finishing tactic: it either closes the goal or raises an error.

  The Lean 3 version of this tactic by default attempted to avoid classical reasoning
  where possible. This Lean 4 version makes no such attempt. The `itauto` tactic
  is designed for that purpose.

syntax "tauto_set"... [Mathlib.Tactic.TautoSet.tacticTauto_set]
  `tauto_set` attempts to prove tautologies involving hypotheses and goals of the form `X ⊆ Y`
  or `X = Y`, where `X`, `Y` are expressions built using ∪, ∩, \, and ᶜ from finitely many
  variables of type `Set α`. It also unfolds expressions of the form `Disjoint A B` and
  `symmDiff A B`.

  Examples:
  ```lean
  example {α} (A B C D : Set α) (h1 : A ⊆ B) (h2 : C ⊆ D) : C \ B ⊆ D \ A := by
    tauto_set

  example {α} (A B C : Set α) (h1 : A ⊆ B ∪ C) : (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) = A := by
    tauto_set
  ```

syntax "tfae_finish"... [Mathlib.Tactic.TFAE.tfaeFinish]
  `tfae_finish` is used to close goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]` once a sufficient collection
  of hypotheses of the form `Pᵢ → Pⱼ` or `Pᵢ ↔ Pⱼ` have been introduced to the local context.

  `tfae_have` can be used to conveniently introduce these hypotheses; see `tfae_have`.

  Example:
  ```lean4
  example : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
    tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry
```
 proof of P → Q 
```lean
tfae_have 2 → 1 := sorry
```
 proof of Q → P 
```lean
tfae_have 2 ↔ 3 := sorry
```
 proof of Q ↔ R 
```lean
tfae_finish
  ```

syntax "tfae_have"... [Mathlib.Tactic.TFAE.tfaeHave]
  `tfae_have` introduces hypotheses for proving goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`. Specifically,
  `tfae_have i <arrow> j := ...` introduces a hypothesis of type `Pᵢ <arrow> Pⱼ` to the local
  context, where `<arrow>` can be `→`, `←`, or `↔`. Note that `i` and `j` are natural number indices
  (beginning at 1) used to specify the propositions `P₁, P₂, ...` that appear in the goal.

  ```lean4
  example (h : P → R) : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
    tfae_have 1 → 3 := h
    ...
  ```
  The resulting context now includes `tfae_1_to_3 : P → R`.

  Once sufficient hypotheses have been introduced by `tfae_have`, `tfae_finish` can be used to close
  the goal. For example,

  ```lean4
  example : TFAE [P, Q, R] := by
    tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry
```
 proof of P → Q 
```lean
tfae_have 2 → 1 := sorry
```
 proof of Q → P 
```lean
tfae_have 2 ↔ 3 := sorry
```
 proof of Q ↔ R 
```lean
tfae_finish
  ```

  All features of `have` are supported by `tfae_have`, including naming, matching,
  destructuring, and goal creation. These are demonstrated below.

  ```lean4
  example : TFAE [P, Q] := by
    -- assert `tfae_1_to_2 : P → Q`:
    tfae_have 1 → 2 := sorry

    -- assert `hpq : P → Q`:
    tfae_have hpq : 1 → 2 := sorry

    -- match on `p : P` and prove `Q` via `f p`:
    tfae_have 1 → 2
    | p => f p

    -- assert `pq : P → Q`, `qp : Q → P`:
    tfae_have ⟨pq, qp⟩ : 1 ↔ 2 := sorry

    -- assert `h : P → Q`; `?a` is a new goal:
    tfae_have h : 1 → 2 := f ?a
    ...
  ```

syntax "tfae_have"... [Mathlib.Tactic.TFAE.tfaeHave']
  `tfae_have` introduces hypotheses for proving goals of the form `TFAE [P₁, P₂, ...]`. Specifically,
  `tfae_have i <arrow> j := ...` introduces a hypothesis of type `Pᵢ <arrow> Pⱼ` to the local
  context, where `<arrow>` can be `→`, `←`, or `↔`. Note that `i` and `j` are natural number indices
  (beginning at 1) used to specify the propositions `P₁, P₂, ...` that appear in the goal.

  ```

syntax "toFinite_tac"... [Set.tacticToFinite_tac]
  A tactic (for use in default params) that applies `Set.toFinite` to synthesize a `Set.Finite`
  term.

syntax "to_encard_tac"... [Set.tacticTo_encard_tac]
  A tactic useful for transferring proofs for `encard` to their corresponding `card` statements

syntax "trace"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.trace]
  Evaluates a term to a string (when possible), and prints it as a trace message.

syntax "trace"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.traceMessage]
  `trace msg` displays `msg` in the info view.

syntax "trace_state"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.traceState]
  `trace_state` displays the current state in the info view.

syntax "trans"... [Batteries.Tactic.tacticTrans___]
  `trans` applies to a goal whose target has the form `t ~ u` where `~` is a transitive relation,
  that is, a relation which has a transitivity lemma tagged with the attribute [trans].

  * `trans s` replaces the goal with the two subgoals `t ~ s` and `s ~ u`.
  * If `s` is omitted, then a metavariable is used instead.

  Additionally, `trans` also applies to a goal whose target has the form `t → u`,
  in which case it replaces the goal with `t → s` and `s → u`.

syntax "transitivity"... [Batteries.Tactic.tacticTransitivity___]
  Synonym for `trans` tactic.

syntax "triv"... [Batteries.Tactic.triv]
  Deprecated variant of `trivial`.

syntax "trivial"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticTrivial]
  `trivial` tries different simple tactics (e.g., `rfl`, `contradiction`, ...)
  to close the current goal.
  You can use the command `macro_rules` to extend the set of tactics used. Example:
  ```
  macro_rules | `(tactic| trivial) => `(tactic| simp)
  ```

syntax "try"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticTry_]
  `try tac` runs `tac` and succeeds even if `tac` failed.

syntax "try?"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tryTrace]

syntax "try_suggestions"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tryResult]
  Helper internal tactic used to implement `evalSuggest` in `try?`

syntax "try_this"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticTry_this__]
  Produces the text `Try this: <tac>` with the given tactic, and then executes it.

syntax "type_check"... [tacticType_check_]
  Type check the given expression, and trace its type.

syntax "unfold"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.unfold]
  * `unfold id` unfolds all occurrences of definition `id` in the target.
  * `unfold id1 id2 ...` is equivalent to `unfold id1; unfold id2; ...`.
  * `unfold id at h` unfolds at the hypothesis `h`.

  Definitions can be either global or local definitions.

  For non-recursive global definitions, this tactic is identical to `delta`.
  For recursive global definitions, it uses the "unfolding lemma" `id.eq_def`,
  which is generated for each recursive definition, to unfold according to the recursive definition given by the user.
  Only one level of unfolding is performed, in contrast to `simp only [id]`, which unfolds definition `id` recursively.

syntax "unfold?"... [Mathlib.Tactic.InteractiveUnfold.tacticUnfold?]
  Replace the selected expression with a definitional unfolding.
  - After each unfolding, we apply `whnfCore` to simplify the expression.
  - Explicit natural number expressions are evaluated.
  - Unfolds of class projections of instances marked with `@[default_instance]` are not shown.
    This is relevant for notational type classes like `+`: we don't want to suggest `Add.add a b`
    as an unfolding of `a + b`. Similarly for `OfNat n : Nat` which unfolds into `n : Nat`.

  To use `unfold?`, shift-click an expression in the tactic state.
  This gives a list of rewrite suggestions for the selected expression.
  Click on a suggestion to replace `unfold?` by a tactic that performs this rewrite.

syntax "unfold_projs"... [Mathlib.Tactic.unfoldProjsStx]
  `unfold_projs at loc` unfolds projections of class instances at the given location.
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

syntax "unhygienic"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.tacticUnhygienic_]
  `unhygienic tacs` runs `tacs` with name hygiene disabled.
  This means that tactics that would normally create inaccessible names will instead
  make regular variables. **Warning**: Tactics may change their variable naming
  strategies at any time, so code that depends on autogenerated names is brittle.
  Users should try not to use `unhygienic` if possible.
  ```
  example : ∀ x : Nat, x = x := by unhygienic
    intro            -- x would normally be intro'd as inaccessible
    exact Eq.refl x  -- refer to x
  ```

syntax "uniqueDiffWithinAt_Ici_Iic_univ"... [intervalIntegral.tacticUniqueDiffWithinAt_Ici_Iic_univ]
  An auxiliary tactic closing goals `UniqueDiffWithinAt ℝ s a` where
  `s ∈ {Iic a, Ici a, univ}`.

syntax "unit_interval"... [Tactic.Interactive.tacticUnit_interval]
  A tactic that solves `0 ≤ ↑x`, `0 ≤ 1 - ↑x`, `↑x ≤ 1`, and `1 - ↑x ≤ 1` for `x : I`.

syntax "unreachable!"... [Batteries.Tactic.unreachable]
  This tactic causes a panic when run (at compile time).
  (This is distinct from `exact unreachable!`, which inserts code which will panic at run time.)

  It is intended for tests to assert that a tactic will never be executed, which is otherwise an
  unusual thing to do (and the `unreachableTactic` linter will give a warning if you do).

  The `unreachableTactic` linter has a special exception for uses of `unreachable!`.
  ```
  example : True := by trivial <;> unreachable!
  ```

syntax "use"... [Mathlib.Tactic.useSyntax]
  `use e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar to `exists`, but unlike `exists` it is equivalent to applying the tactic
  `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_, ⋯, ?_⟩` with any number of placeholders (rather than just one) and
  then trying to close goals associated to the placeholders with a configurable discharger (rather
  than just `try trivial`).

  Examples:

  ```lean
  example : ∃ x : Nat, x = x := by use 42

  example : ∃ x : Nat, ∃ y : Nat, x = y := by use 42, 42

  example : ∃ x : String × String, x.1 = x.2 := by use ("forty-two", "forty-two")
  ```

  `use! e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar but it applies constructors everywhere rather than just for
  goals that correspond to the last argument of a constructor. This gives the effect that
  nested constructors are being flattened out, with the supplied values being used along the
  leaves and nodes of the tree of constructors.
  With `use!` one can feed in each `42` one at a time:

  ```lean
  example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! 42, 42

  example : ∃ p : Nat × Nat, p.1 = p.2 := by use! (42, 42)
  ```

  The second line makes use of the fact that `use!` tries refining with the argument before
  applying a constructor. Also note that `use`/`use!` by default uses a tactic
  called `use_discharger` to discharge goals, so `use! 42` will close the goal in this example since
  `use_discharger` applies `rfl`, which as a consequence solves for the other `Nat` metavariable.

  These tactics take an optional discharger to handle remaining explicit `Prop` constructor arguments.
  By default it is `use (discharger := try with_reducible use_discharger) e₁, e₂, ⋯`.
  To turn off the discharger and keep all goals, use `(discharger := skip)`.
  To allow "heavy refls", use `(discharger := try use_discharger)`.

syntax "use!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.«tacticUse!___,,»]
  `use e₁, e₂, ⋯` is similar to `exists`, but unlike `exists` it is equivalent to applying the tactic
  `refine ⟨e₁, e₂, ⋯, ?_, ⋯, ?_⟩` with any number of placeholders (rather than just one) and
  then trying to close goals associated to the placeholders with a configurable discharger (rather
  than just `try trivial`).

  Examples:

  ```lean

  To allow "heavy refls", use `(discharger := try use_discharger)`.

syntax "use_discharger"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticUse_discharger]
  Default discharger to try to use for the `use` and `use!` tactics.
  This is similar to the `trivial` tactic but doesn't do things like `contradiction` or `decide`.

syntax "use_finite_instance"... [tacticUse_finite_instance]
  Try using `Set.toFinite` to dispatch a `Set.Finite` goal.

syntax "valid"... [CategoryTheory.ComposableArrows.tacticValid]
  A wrapper for `omega` which prefaces it with some quick and useful attempts

syntax "volume_tac"... [MeasureTheory.tacticVolume_tac]
  The tactic `exact volume`, to be used in optional (`autoParam`) arguments.

syntax "wait_for_unblock_async"... [Lean.Server.Test.Cancel.tacticWait_for_unblock_async]
  Spawns a `logSnapshotTask` that waits for `unblock` to be called, which is expected to happen in a
  subsequent document version that does not invalidate this tactic. Complains if cancellation token
  was set before unblocking, i.e. if the tactic was invalidated after all.

syntax "whisker_simps"... [Mathlib.Tactic.BicategoryCoherence.whisker_simps]
  Simp lemmas for rewriting a 2-morphism into a normal form.

syntax "whnf"... [Mathlib.Tactic.tacticWhnf__]
  `whnf at loc` puts the given location into weak-head normal form.
  This also exists as a `conv`-mode tactic.

  Weak-head normal form is when the outer-most expression has been fully reduced, the expression
  may contain subexpressions which have not been reduced.

syntax "with_panel_widgets"... [ProofWidgets.withPanelWidgetsTacticStx]
  Display the selected panel widgets in the nested tactic script. For example,
  assuming we have written a `GeometryDisplay` component,
  ```lean
  by with_panel_widgets [GeometryDisplay]
    simp
    rfl
  ```
  will show the geometry display alongside the usual tactic state throughout the proof.

syntax "with_reducible"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.withReducible]
  `with_reducible tacs` executes `tacs` using the reducible transparency setting.
  In this setting only definitions tagged as `[reducible]` are unfolded.

syntax "with_reducible_and_instances"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.withReducibleAndInstances]
  `with_reducible_and_instances tacs` executes `tacs` using the `.instances` transparency setting.
  In this setting only definitions tagged as `[reducible]` or type class instances are unfolded.

syntax "with_unfolding_all"... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.withUnfoldingAll]
  `with_unfolding_all tacs` executes `tacs` using the `.all` transparency setting.
  In this setting all definitions that are not opaque are unfolded.

syntax "witt_truncateFun_tac"... [witt_truncateFun_tac]
  A macro tactic used to prove that `truncateFun` respects ring operations.

syntax "wlog"... [Mathlib.Tactic.wlog]
  `wlog h : P` will add an assumption `h : P` to the main goal, and add a side goal that requires
  showing that the case `h : ¬ P` can be reduced to the case where `P` holds (typically by symmetry).

  The side goal will be at the top of the stack. In this side goal, there will be two additional
  assumptions:
  - `h : ¬ P`: the assumption that `P` does not hold
  - `this`: which is the statement that in the old context `P` suffices to prove the goal.
    By default, the name `this` is used, but the idiom `with H` can be added to specify the name:
    `wlog h : P with H`.

  Typically, it is useful to use the variant `wlog h : P generalizing x y`,
  to revert certain parts of the context before creating the new goal.
  In this way, the wlog-claim `this` can be applied to `x` and `y` in different orders
  (exploiting symmetry, which is the typical use case).

  By default, the entire context is reverted.

syntax "wlog!"... [Mathlib.Tactic.wlog!]
  `wlog! h : P` is a variant of the `wlog h : P` tactic that also calls `push_neg` at the generated
  hypothesis `h : ¬ p` in the side goal. `wlog! h : P ∧ Q` will transform `¬ (P ∧ Q)` to `P → ¬ Q`,
  while  `wlog! +distrib h : P ∧ Q` will transform `¬ (P ∧ Q)` to `P ∨ Q`. For more information, see
  the documentation on `push_neg`.

syntax "zify"... [Mathlib.Tactic.Zify.zify]
  The `zify` tactic is used to shift propositions from `Nat` to `Int`.
  This is often useful since `Int` has well-behaved subtraction.
  ```
  example (a b c x y z : Nat) (h : ¬ x*y*z < 0) : c < a + 3*b := by
    zify
    zify at h
```

    h : ¬↑x * ↑y * ↑z < 0
    ⊢ ↑c < ↑a + 3 * ↑b
    
```lean
```
  `zify` can be given extra lemmas to use in simplification. This is especially useful in the
  presence of nat subtraction: passing `≤` arguments will allow `push_cast` to do more work.
  ```
  example (a b c : Nat) (h : a - b < c) (hab : b ≤ a) : false := by
    zify [hab] at h
```
 h : ↑a - ↑b < ↑c 
```lean
```
  `zify` makes use of the `@[zify_simps]` attribute to move propositions,
  and the `push_cast` tactic to simplify the `Int`-valued expressions.
  `zify` is in some sense dual to the `lift` tactic.
  `lift (z : Int) to Nat` will change the type of an
  integer `z` (in the supertype) to `Nat` (the subtype), given a proof that `z ≥ 0`;
  propositions concerning `z` will still be over `Int`.
  `zify` changes propositions about `Nat` (the subtype) to propositions about `Int` (the supertype),
  without changing the type of any variable.

syntax "∎"... [«tactic∎»]
  `∎` (typed as `\qed`) is a macro that expands to `try?` in tactic mode.

syntax ... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.nestedTactic]

syntax ... [Lean.Parser.Tactic.unknown]

syntax ... [Lean.cdot]
  `· tac` focuses on the main goal and tries to solve it using `tac`, or else fails.
